      Mark of the Unicorn is trademark of Mark of the Unicorn, Inc.<br>
      <br>
      FreeStyle by Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU) was released in 1994 and
      updated until the early 2000's, when it stopped being a commercial
      product, and now considered abandoned ware.<br>
      It was wrongly perceived as Mark Of The Unicorn's budget, cut-down
      sequencer (version 2 later included Event list editing), but at
      the time it cost the same as Steinberg's Cubasis.<br>
      <br>
      FreeStyle is still a very capable and unique MIDI sequencer today.<br>
      It excels at live MIDI instrument <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_improvisation">improv</a>,
      recording and fast song building, it's notable features include:<br>
      * Trackless concept, using color coded players (instrument) with
      multiple named <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take#Music_recording">takes</a>
      and alternating between them quickly.<br>
      * Record and compose in linear (ie tape recording) or patterns (ie
      drum machine) and interchange between them seamlessly.<br>
      * Music score notation view allows recording, editing and
      printing, with basic text editing.<br>
      * Event list with step recording shortcut keys. Edit notes,
      controller or System Exclusive data etc.<br>
      * Remote control via MIDI Keyboard. Transport controls and cycle
      through sections, players, takes and sounds etc.<br>
      * Capable piano roll view with MIDI controller grid.<br>
      * Loop points with override, <br>
      * Beat detection and individual or variable tempo map.<br>
      * Key change, transpose, quantize, <br>
      * Layered sound (multiple instruments to a single player).<br>
      * Move or duplicate notes, paste to the cursor or
      measure-relative.<br>
      * Modern USB and virtual MIDI device support, MIDI lock channel,
      SMPTE sync.<br>
      * Standard MIDI File (.mid) import and export.<br>

      FreeStyle uses traditional musical terms instead of DAW or MIDI
      Sequencer terms:<br>
      <ul>
        <li> A collection of instruments (Players) is called an ensemble
          (band, orchestra, GM MIDI, sample bank etc).</li>
        <li>A track is represented by it's Player (musician). </li>
        <li>Each Player can have one or many <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take#Music_recording">Takes</a>
          (a performance ie, an alternative, <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_improvisation">improv</a>
          etc) </li>
        <li>A Section is made up by Players and their selected (active)
          Take. </li>
        <li>A song's Arrangement (song composing, remix, reworking, etc)
          is composed from many Sections.</li>
        <li> The Piano Roll interface is called Graphical view/display
          or Graphic editor.</li>
        <li>A step is one part of a time signature, ie 4 4 time
          signature, a step would be a quarter note.</li>
        <li>A bar or measure is 4 time signatures in length, ie 8 steps
          using a 4 4 time signature.<br>

      <b>Virtual Machines.<br>
      </b>Virtual Machines can be a convenient way of working
      (encapsulating workflow, portable, no distractions, etc), however
      older windows (95, 98, NT, 2000) versions are harder to setup
      (obsolete VM driver support) and reliant on older software that's
      unavailable or hard to find and are therefore not recommended.<br>
      <br>
      If you are a Linux or Mac user than a <a
        href="https://archive.org/details/win-11-pro-24-h-2.3775-oprekin.com">Windows

        10/11 x64bit Virtual Machine</a> is recommended and works well
      however, Virtual Machines have very delayed audio and it's <u>strongly

        recommended</u> avoiding the Guest OS audio system for music
      production, here are a few options:<br>
      * External USB sound card as a passed through sound card. Cheap or
      expensive, it will fix the audio lag issue and this is relatively
      convenient and easy to do.<br>
      * USB MIDI interface passed through directly to the Virtual
      Machine, it will produce no audio, instead your MIDI equipment
      will and without much of a delay.<br>
      * MIDI Over Lan&nbsp; (MIDI Over IP) is also a possible solution
      to avoid audio lag but can be complicated to setup.<br>
      * Simply avoid Virtual machines by getting a cheap or 2nd hand
      computer dedicated for just Windows music production.<b><br>
      </b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Linux (untested).</b><br>
      FreeStyle might work under wine but it has to start FreeMIDI
      first.<br>

      FreeStyle doesn't start if the MIDI set up isn't exactly what was
      configured previously. To simplify the processing of setting
      everything up before FreeStyle is started, FS_Helper will run
      command line batch files when starting and also when exiting.
      FS_Helper looks for these two batch files:<br>
      FS_Helper\fs_start.bat<br>
      FS_Helper\fs_exit.bat<br>
      <br>
      <b>FS_Helper\fs_start.bat</b> is called before FreeStyle starts
      and can be used to setup your applications, ie:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start /B "" "C:\Program
      Files (x86)\Tobias Erichsen\loopMIDI\loopMIDI.exe" <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start /WAIT "" "cmd /c ping
      127.0.0.1 -n 3 &gt;nul"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start /B "" "C:\extras\MIDI
      Tools\MIDIOX\midiox.exe"<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; start /B "" "C:\Program
      Files\VirtualMIDISynth\VirtualMIDISynth.exe"<br>
      <br>
      This batch file will start LoopMIDI in the background, wait for it
      to start and run correctly, then starts MIDIOX and
      VirtualMIDISynth, when the start batch file is finished, FreeStyle
      is loaded as normal.<br>
      FS_Helper will not run fs_start.bat if FreeStyle is already
      running.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>FS_Helper\fs_exit.bat </b>is called when FS_Helper detects
      that FreeStyle has been closed, it can be used to close the extra
      applications you started in the starting batch file, ie:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taskkill /IM
      "VirtualMIDISynth.exe" /F<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taskkill /IM "midiox.exe" /F
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taskkill /IM "loopMIDI.exe"
      /F <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      This batch file will terminate VirtualMIDISynth, MIDIOX, then
      LoopMIDI before FS_Helper itself is terminated.<br>
      <br>
      Note: If the batch file exists, they can not be empty and must
      have at least a single command line to run.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they are not
      required, delete or rename them so they aren't used.<br>

      * Shift toggles 11 - 20. Extends the range above by adding 10, so
      Shift + 1 key = player 11 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding Shift, Alt and Tab via MIDI might

      The above shortcuts are also available via MIDI CC extends
      FreeStyle's Remote Controls.<br>
      The MIDI shortcuts are only mappable to CC events (not notes) and
      configured via the FS_Helper script.<br>
      Make sure your MIDI controller is connected and working.<br>
      Close FreeStyle and edit the FS_Helper\FS_Helper.ahk file, all the
      MIDI settings are at the top of the file.<br>
      <br>
      First, to enable MIDI shortcuts, change this line from:<br>
      midiInDeviceId := -1<br>
      To:<br>
      midiInDeviceId := 0<br>
      <br>
      And also activate debugging by changing this line from:<br>
      midiInDeviceDebug := 0<br>
      To:<br>
      midiInDeviceDebug := 1<br>
      <br>
      Every time you make a change to FS_Helper.ahk you have to:
      recompile and deploy and restart FS_Helper. Running
      build_deploy.bat located in FS_Helper folder does this for you.<br>
      You will get a message window displaying all the available MIDI
      devices, remember the device you want to use for MIDI input.<br>
      <br>
      Change this line from:<br>
      midiInDeviceId := 0<br>
      To:<br>
      midiInDeviceId := X<br>
      <br>
      Where X is the number corresponding to your MIDI input device from
      the message window.<br>
      Save and run build_deploy.bat.<br>
      <br>
      Next, when you change a CC button on your keyboard, FS_Helper will
      display the CC number, this can be helpful for mapping your
      keyboard to the shortcuts, by simply replacing the shortcut values
      with your keyboard's button numbers. For example, if you're
      keyboard #1 button sends a value of 61, set the following line:<br>
      MIDI_PLAYER_1 := 51<br>
      To:<br>
      MIDI_PLAYER_1 := 61 <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      When you are finished mapping the shortcuts, you can turn off the
      debugging by setting the debug value back to zero, ie:<br>
      midiInDeviceDebug := 0<br>
      <br>
      To disable MIDI shortcuts, reset the midiInDeviceId to -1:<br>
      midiInDeviceId := -1<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The PC keyboard shortcuts aren't great and can be also changed,
      but require some AutoHotScript v1 knowledge, all keyboard
      shortcuts are at the bottom of the FS_Helper.ahk file.<br>
      Note: All the shortcuts above apply to all windows with in
      FreeStyle and replace the original functionality, ie the A to Z
      keys will not insert sections in the Arrangement windows as per
      the original shortcuts. <br>
      <br>
      PS: Sorry about the horribly messy code, it's was all done by
      trail and error and never cleaned up.<br>

      <h2>Notes and tips.</h2>
      <p> * FreeStyle has only, <u><b>one single level of undo and redo</b></u>,
        which was common with early sequencers. To remedy this, you can
        duplicate the current take (Alt F7) or section (CTRL D).</p>
      * Copy and paste works but not with copy past managers and using
      it creates a persistent (and annoying) warning message when
      clicking out of FreeStyle about not enough memory.<br>
      &nbsp; So it's not recommended, hold the CTRL key and moving the
      selected notes will create a copy in a different location. <br>
      <p> * If the cursor goes <b>past</b> the Loop points and set to
        active, it will automatically snap back into the loop. However,
        if the cursor is <b>before</b> the loop points, it will not.
        This issue (bug?) is also the same with the Rewind Marker. Also
        the rewind doesn't go back to the loop's beginning, instead the
        sections start point.<br>
      </p>
      <p> * FreeStyle is relatively stable when configure correctly, if
        you are experiencing a crash during the same play back try
        clearing the MIDI configuration and try again. If it still
        persist it's most likely a bug. Try reading the <a
href="file:///home/xp/Downloads/MOTU%20Freestyle%20v2.31/docs/FreeStyle_extended_help/index.html#README">Readme!.doc












          "Running on a slow computer" </a> section to avoid crashing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *
        Single MIDI devices that receive a lot of data can cause
        FreeStyle to crash if the MIDI device doesn't perform as
        expected, ie dropped messages. Recommend to have multiple
        virtual MIDI devices to share the load over CPU cores.<br>
      </p>
      <p> * If your audio is generated on your sound card, it's
        recommended to use audio devices that lets you control the audio
        buffer size for low latency and avoiding Windows' General MIDI
        because it's high in latency.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <b>MIDI device setup.<br>
      </b><br>
      * FreeStyle will not start and just hang or crash before starting
      if there are no MIDI device (with a MIDI driver) in your device
      manager window and configured and running correctly, and to play
      MIDI audio from your computer you need to have a MIDI playback
      device installed or external MIDI devices etc. To clear your MIDI
      settings run: del /F /Q C:\Windows\Freemidi\FMSPREFS and restart
      FreeStyle.<br>
      <br>
      * Your MIDI device should be fully working and be able to have
      multiple <a href="https://www.midiox.com/">MIDIOX</a> instances
      connected and running, if it doesn't the MIDI FS_Helper features
      (explained above) will not work, check your driver settings etc.
      You should know how your MIDI controller device interfaces (Device
      Name, MIDI2, MIDI3 etc) with DAW software and what how it sends
      what where.<br>
      <br>
      * If you change your MIDI setup and start FreeStyle, it may cause
      a crash, in which case you have to clear your FreeMIDI
      configuration: Run: del /F /Q C:\Windows\Freemidi\FMSPREFS and
      restart FreeStyle.&nbsp; <u><b><br>
        </b></u><br>
      * FreeStyle doesn't seem to acknowledge any channel data from MIDI
      In. All CC's, notes etc via MIDI In will <b>only</b> be applied
      to the current record activated player only.<br>
      <br>
      * FreeMIDI, FreeStyle's MIDI interface typically see's MIDI
      keyboards as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPU-401">MPU-401</a>
      device (an early Roland's MIDI equipment standard)&nbsp; if it
      doesn't the piano keyboard wont work and only the controllers will
      work. Tick your Hardware input device, but don't setup a virtual
      device for it. FreeStyle will still use it, sometimes even if it's
      not ticked.<br>
      <br>
      * Use <a
        href="https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html">LoopMIDI</a>,
      not the free <a href="https://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html">loopbe1</a>,
      it mutes with false positives (feedback loops) and it can't not be
      configured.<br>
      <br>
      * Generic Synth is Microsoft's GM MIDI device, you can disable it
      by unticking it in Device Usage window (AKA FreeMIDI Preferences).<br>
      <u><b> </b></u><br>
      <br>
      Using your MIDI device (as a MPU-401) and the Generic Synth is the
      simplest and quickest setup.<br>
      The next easiest setup is when the device is "known" by FreeMIDI,
      which means it understands the device's in and out and channel
      transmit/receive settings.<br>
      There are two types of these, GM MIDI and non-GM MIDI (or at least
      it couldn't detect GM MIDI). Non GM MIDI devices only require
      telling FreeMIDI what it is ie GM MIDI or sampler, etc and that's
      it. <a href="https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth">VirtualMIDISynth</a>
      is an example of non-GM MIDI and is easy to setup and use.<br>
      <br>
      The most complicated setup is telling FreeMIDI the device in, out
      and channel send and receive settings manually, this is detailed
      below.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;For further details on MIDI setup see the help info by
      searching for "Device Usage button".<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Manual MIDI setup is complicated at first and often involves a lot
      of crashing to set up correctly, this is "normal".<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b><u>Note: The Device Usage... window will automatically filter
          the device's ports (in/out) to the correct FreeMIDI and
          FreeStyle in/out configuration - Only select the In and Out
          you need!</u></b><br>
      Sometimes it's devices and mapping is incorrect and requires
      resetting. Run: del /F /Q C:\Windows\Freemidi\FMSPREFS and restart
      FreeStyle.<br>
      <br>
      Firstly, my understanding is that the MIDI in and out
      configuration is opposite to how we would see it today.<br>
      You are setting up a virtual device in FreeMIDI with In and Out
      and it's seen from the FreeMIDI's virtual devices' point of view.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b><b>FreeMIDI's </b>Virtual device MIDI In &lt;- FreeMIDI's
        ticked device MIDI Out.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      If that doesn't make much sense to you, then you are not alone!!!<br>
      But that is my best understanding of how to configure it, and
      making some kind of sense!<b><u><br>
        </u></b><br>
      A more verbose way to see it is by using the interactions and
      configurations between the two separate applications, FreeStyle
      and FreeMIDI.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FreeStyle's MIDI Out -&gt; to FreeMIDI's device MIDI In (which
        is setup to FreeMIDI's ticked device MIDI Out).</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Or<br>
      <br>
      <b>FreeStyle's MIDI Out -&gt; to FreeMIDI's device MIDI In -&gt;
        which then goes to the actual device. [And thus a FreeStyle MIDI
        Out?]</b><br>
      <br>
      I'm not 100% sure on how it's routing, and why the device's out is
      selected as an input but it works. <br>
      So, just pick your device and MIDI output:<br>
      <br>
      <b>MIDI in: Device (MIDI output).</b><br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Using the image above, the setup can be explained as:<br>

      FreeStyle sends MIDI to FreeMIDI which then forwards it to the
      device, which is <a
        href="https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html">LoopMIDI</a>.<br>
      MIDIOX listens to LoopMIDI and displays and forwards MIDI to
      Microsoft's GM MIDI device to play the notes. This is a good way
      to debug your setup.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from hardware controllers, <b>DO NOT SEND ANY OTHER MIDI In</b>
      - It will typically crash FreeStyle, especially if using LoopMIDI,
      other routing might work, so do your own research.<br>
      The only way to stop FreeStyle from receiving MIDI is <b>not to
        tick the device's (MIDI input) In the Device Usage</b>...
      window, as in the image above, leave it with no connection.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Setting up as a modern DAW.</h4>
      You can use FreeStyle similar to a modern DAW but obviously with
      no audio features and no ability to record external instrument
      changes as explained above, unless it's recorded via FreeStyle and
      sent as normal MIDI data.<br>
      <br>
      You can add virtual MIDI devices (ie <a
        href="https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html">LoopMIDI</a>)
      and external, standalone programs, including some VSTi's.<br>

      As long as the external instruments are preconfigured correctly
      and do not change during the recording, FreeStyle will play them
      as expected.<br>
      You can mix down the playback into an audio file (.mp3, .ogg
      etc)&nbsp; using an audio program like audacity to record what's
      playing through the speakers.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FreeStyle
        requires MIDI-equipped hardware to record and play back music.
        For playback, you can use a MIDI-equipped sound card or an
        external keyboard synthesizer or sound module. For more

            Installing a MIDI Driver</font></b><br>
        <font size="2"><br>
          A MIDI driver is software that you install into Windows that
          allows FreeStyle to communicate with your MIDI device(s) for
          playback and recording. A Windows-compatible MIDI driver
          should have been included on a disk with your MIDI-equipped
          sound card, MIDI interface, or MIDI instrument(if it has a
          built-in MIDI interface). If you do not have a Windows driver
          for your device, contact the manufacturer.<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font size="2"><br>
          &gt;&gt; If you don't yet have a MIDI driver installed, you
          must install it before running FreeStyle. FreeStyle requires
          you to install at least one MIDI driver.<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font size="2">Follow the appropriate procedure
          below to install or update your MIDI driver(s) in Windows 95,
          98, NT, or 2000.<br>
        </font>If you need to add a MIDI device to your computer, first
        turn off your computer and physically install or connect your
        MIDI device (multi-port interface, sound card, etc.). Be sure to
        check the device documentation for the proper physical
        installation procedure. Once the device has been installed or
        attached, turn your computer back on.<br>
        IMPORTANT: After the driver has been installed and configured,
        you will be prompted to restart Windows. You must restart
        Windows for the new driver to take effect. When Windows
        restarts, your MIDI device should be ready to use.<font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2"><br>
          &gt;&gt; NOTE: If the Wizard didn't list your MIDI device and
          you don't have a CD or diskette for it, or for technical
          support on loading and configuring the device's driver, you
          should contact the device manufacturer, NOT Mark of the
          Unicorn, Inc. or Microsoft Corporation.<font size="3"><br>

            How to install or update a MIDI driver in Windows 95 or 98</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">If the new device is Plug &amp; Play, Windows
          should either automatically load the device's driver files or
          prompt you to provide them (probably by inserting a floppy
          diskette or CD included with the device). Windows 95/98 should
          be able to load and configure the appropriate driver for the
          device automatically. If this is the case, you can stop
          reading this file right now since the Windows 95/98 Plug &amp;
          Play system will take care of everything automatically.<br>
        </font>If the new device is not Plug &amp; Play, you will have
        to load and configure the driver yourself. To do so, open
        Control Panel and double-click the "Add New Hardware" icon. In
        general, follow the Add New Hardware wizard's on-screen
        instructions.<font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2"><br>
          [ WINDOWS 98 ONLY: ]<br>
          [ You will see a dialog that says, "Windows will now search
          for any new Plug and Play devices on your system. ... To
          continue, click Next." You must click Next and wait a few
          seconds, even if you know that your device will not be found.
          Next you will see a dialog that says, "Is the device that you
          want to install listed below?" Select the "No" radio button
          and click the "Next" button. Next you will see a dialog that
          says, "Windows can now search for hardware that is not Plug
          and Play compatible, or you can select your hardware from a
          list. ... Do you want Windows to search for your new
          hardware?" Select the "No" radio button and click the "Next"

          you to specify the MIDI device yourself. Selecting "Yes" to
          allow Windows to search for non-Plug &amp; Play MIDI devices
          MAY NOT WORK. If you know what kind of device you want to add,
          you are better off selecting "No" and then manually specifying
          the device, as described below.<br>
        </font>After selecting "No" and clicking "Next", the next step
        in the Wizard is to specify a hardware type. From the Wizard's
        "Hardware types" list, scroll-down and choose...<font size="3"><br>

          devices. Click "Next" and then determine if your MIDI device
          appears in the Wizard's list. If it does, select your device
          from the list, click "Next" and skip the following paragraph.<br>
        </font>If the Wizard did NOT list your device, but you DO have a
        CD or diskette for the device, insert the CD or diskette into
        your computer and click the special "Have disk..." button to the
        right. In the resulting "Install From Disk" dialog, specify the
        drive letter of your floppy or CD drive, followed by a colon and
        a backslash, and then click "OK". A list will appear containing
        one or more entries. Choose the entry appropriate for your MIDI
        device and click "OK".<br>
        Continue to follow the Wizard's instructions. When it finishes,
        a configuration dialog for your MIDI device may appear. At this

            several of the most common ways:<font size="3"><br>

              Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">The Control Palette provides buttons that
          look just like the controls on a CD Player or tape deck: play,
          stop, pause, rewind, and record. Use these buttons to get
          around in your music. They operate just like a standard tape
          deck, except that things happen instantly because you don't
          have to wait for tape to rewind.<br>
        </font>The counter shows the current playback location in the
        music. The location is displayed in measures, beats, and ticks
        (there are 960 ticks per quarter note) or in minutes, seconds,
        and tenths of a second.<br>
        The tempo slider lets you change the tempo of your music at any
        time. Unlike a tape deck or CD player, however, changing the
        tempo of your music won't affect its pitch. The Tempo Mode menu
        lets you play your music at a constant tempo or a variable,
        changing tempo as determined by a tempo map that you have
        created. The Record Mode menu lets you record to a click or
        freely without one.<br>
        Tempo is displayed in beats per minute (bpm). Drag the tempo
        slider to change the tempo, or type in a tempo. In the Variable
        tempo mode, the slider is usable only while recording. In the
        Constant or % Variable tempo modes, it adjusts the overall tempo
        of your song.<br>

          produces a metronome click (or a 'riff') and you follow
          FreeStyle as you record. The Sense tempo modes let you record
          a rubato performance without listening to an audible click.

        </font><font size="2">Also known as Piano Roll, FreeStyle
          provides two intuitive environments in which to view and edit
          your music: the graphic editing and notation views. These
          views are where you'll do the majority of your work in
          FreeStyle. Both views exist in the same window, and you toggle
          between them using the buttons shown below. Think of them as
          two windows through which you view the same music.<font

        </font><font size="2">Both views can show any combination of
          players at any time. Just highlight the player names you want
          to see in the Ensemble palette. In the Graphic Editing view,
          each player is shown in a unique color or pattern (depending
          on the setting in the Preferences command). In the notation
          view, each player gets its own staff or grand staff.<br>
        </font>Both views can display any section or song in the
        document. Just choose the desired section or song from the
        pop-up menu at the top of the window. When you view a song, you
        see all of its sections together at once. The boundaries between
        sections are indicated by heavy vertical lines in the note grid.<font

        </font><font size="2">The notation display is dynamic: you can
          fully edit the music using the same conventions as graphic
          (Piano Roll) editing. Changes in either view are immediately
          reflected in the other. When you record, the staves
          immediately fill up with the notes you play as you record.
          Unlike other simplistic music software programs, FreeStyle's
          notation transcription is a sophisticated interpretation of
          the raw MIDI data you record. For example, if you play swing,
          turn on the Straighten Swing feature in the Setup menu (under
          the Notation menu item) and FreeStyle writes it using straight
          rhythms instead of triplets.<font size="3"><br>

          </font><font size="2">FreeStyle's notation view is a WYSIWYG
            (what you see is what you get) page view: what you see on
            the screen is exactly what you will get when you print.
            Music is automatically placed on as many pages as are
            necessary. FreeStyle manages the note spacing, measures
            widths, and staff spacing so that musical symbols never
            collide.<font size="3"><br>

            size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">When you display one player by itself,
            FreeStyle automatically transposes the part according to
            standard practice for the instrument. For example, alto sax
            players are transposed to Eb. The Edit Player Info command
            in the Setup menu lets you choose how an individual player
            is transposed, as well as the amount of space needed between
            its staff and neighboring staves.<br>
          </font>When you display more than one player at a time in the
          Notation view (a score), FreeStyle is configured "out of the
          box" to use concert pitch for all players. But you can change
          any player's score transposition to be anything you want. To
          do so, click the player in the Ensemble palette to select it
          and choose Edit Player Info from the Setup menu. Then set the
          Score transposition as desired. Most commonly, you'll either
          leave it set to concert pitch (C natural) or you'll make it
          identical to the player's part transposition. This is also a
          good place to transpose by octave parts that tend to be
          displayed too many ledger lines above or below the staff, such
          as a bass part that your MIDI instrument plays an octave lower
          than you would like it to be notated.<font size="3"><br>

          "Under the hood", when you record music into FreeStyle, the
          program actually records MIDI data from your MIDI instrument.
          When you play a note, press the sustain pedal, or move your
          pitch bend wheel, your MIDI keyboard sends a stream of
          numerical MIDI data representing your performance to
          FreeStyle, which faithfully records it. Most of the time,
          FreeStyle frees you from this level of technical detail so you
          can focus on your music. However there may be times when it
          would help you to see the MIDI data in its raw, numerical
          form. The Event List window does just that, giving you precise
          control over your music.<b></b><br>

          To the left of the scrolling list of MIDI data is the wiper
          bar, which contains FreeStyle's familiar scrolling playback
          wiper. Click anywhere in the bar to advance playback to that
          location. As usual, you can scrub the music by grabbing the
          handle of the wiper and dragging it up or down - but remember,
          the Silent Scrubbing preference (in the Edit menu) must be
          unchecked for notes to sound as you scrub.<font size="3"><br>

            detailed characteristics - of each event in the list. For
            example, FreeStyle shows the velocity (vel) of each note,
            which is a number between zero and 127 that represents how
            hard the note was struck when you played it. To edit any
            parameter, just double-click the number and type in the
            desired value. Press the return key to confirm your edit, or
            use the arrow keys to confirm your edit and move to adjacent
            parameters in the list. Use the Enter key to confirm the
            edit and move to the next event.<br>
          </font>Each column gives you details about each MIDI event.
          "ST" stands for Step Time, which refers to the length of time
          until the next event. The ST value lets you easily see and
          edit how far apart events are from one another. "Dur" stands
          for Duration, which refers to the duration of notes. For types
          of data that don't have duration, like a volume controller
          event, the Duration column shows other information, such as
          the volume level.<br>
          Note: ST values can't be edited when you are viewing a song.<br>
          The note icons displayed to the right of the pitch on some
          notes do NOT represent the note's duration. Instead, they
          represent the note's approximate Step Time duration (the
          amount of time until the next event).<br>
          Use the up/down arrow keys to select events from the computer
          keyboard.<br>
          Use the left/right and up/down arrow keys to edit data.<br>
          If a note appears grayed, it means that the note is actually a
          pick-up note generated by FreeStyle with the <u>Smooth Record
            Loop option</u> turned on. On black and white monitors, the
          note is displayed in italics.<br>
          If a note appears in italics, it means that the note is

            </font><font size="2">The ST value of an event is its Step
              Time, which is the distance between it and the next event
              in the list. Changing the ST value is different than
              changing the other parameters of the event because the ST
              value affects all of the events that follow it in the
              event list.<br>
            </font>Here's an example: let's say that you change the ST
            of an event from 480 to 960. In doing so, you've just moved
            later by 480 ticks all of the events after it that are
            currently being displayed in the event list. So you've
            actually performed a Move operation, just as if you had used
            the Move command in the Region menu. Further, the event
            whose ST time you changed hasn't moved at all, since the ST
            time affects only what comes after the event. As you can
            see, it is important to make note of which players you are
            showing in the Event List before editing ST values (as
            indicated by which ones are highlighted in the Ensemble
            palette). Be sure to keep these things in mind when you are
            editing ST values.<br>
            And here's another thing to keep in mind: ST edits are
            subject to the same restrictions as the Move command (since
            they are essentially the exact same type of edit operation).
            For example, you cannot move events past the end of a
            section. These same rules apply when editing ST values: you
            cannot edit an ST time such that any subsequent events are
            shifted past the end of the section. In addition, FreeStyle
            will not allow you to edit ST values when you are viewing a
            song in the Event List. You have to change to a section in
            order to do so.<font size="3"><br>

                represent much more than just a sound on your MIDI
                instrument. They also have many settings that control
                the way they are presented throughout the program. For
                example, the Player Info window has several options that
                control how the player is formatted when displayed in
                the Notation view.<br>
              </font>Choose a sound from one of your MIDI instruments
              from the Sound menu.<br>
              The transpose recording option transposes your controller
              when you are recording the player. It helps with players
              whose note range falls outside the range of the keys on
              your controller, such as a bass player. This also allows
              you to read a Bb trumpet part, for example, and record it
              in Bb while the rest of the ensemble is playing in
              concert.<br>
              The player abbreviation appears in the notation display to
              the left of each staff (except the first one) when more
              than two players are being displayed.<br>
              The 'Save in Player library' button replaces the existing
              player library entry with the current settings.If you want
              to lock a player's sound to a specific MIDI channel, use
              the 'Channel' menu. <br>
              If you want FreeStyle to dynamically choose a MIDI channel
              for you based on its built-in knowledge about your MIDI
              instrument, select 'Auto.'.<br>
              The clef and staff spacing options determine the clef and
              spacing between the staves when the player is displayed in
              the notation view.<br>
              The transpose options control how the player is transposed
              when it is displayed as a part (by itself in the notation
              view) or in a score (with other players).<font size="3"><br>

                  when recording new music. Each player can record an
                  unlimited number of takes. Each player has a different
                  set of takes for each section of music (Intro, Chorus,
                  Verse, etc.) To view takes for a section, choose the

              Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">Sections are the basic building blocks of
          music in FreeStyle. A section is a place to store music. It
          can be anything, from a 2-bar drum loop to a 300-bar
          orchestral movement. It consists of a "pickup" measure, a
          start, an end, and an "overhang" measure. Most importantly,
          each section has its own set of takes for each player. For
          example, take 1 for the Piano player in the Intro section is
          different from the Piano player's take 1 in the Verse. Only
          one take is active for each player at any time in a section.
          But different players can play different takes. For example,
          the piano player might be playing take 3 in the Verse, while
          the bass player is playing take 6.<br>
        </font>Sections also have their own tempo maps, which are
        displayed in the Tempo Source menu at the top of the Ensemble
        palette.<font size="3"><br>

          New Section from the Song menu. FreeStyle asks you to name it.
          After you do so and click OK, the section appears at the
          bottom of the Section list in the Arrangement window. It also
          appears in the Graphic Editing/Notation window, empty and
          ready to be recorded into.<font size="3"><br>

            initially given a length of four bars, but if you record
            past the end of a section, it will grow to accommodate the
            notes you play in. If the section has been placed in a song
            and it butts up against another section, FreeStyle won't
            automatically grow the section any more.<br>
          </font>To adjust the length of a section, drag the heavy,
          black double-lined vertical end bar displayed in the Graphic
          Editing window in the note grid. You can also adjust its
          length anywhere it appears in the Arrangement window grid:
          just grab the right edge of the section and drag it.<font

        of "patterns" (like verse, chorus, bridge, etc.), but you don't
        have to. You can also use sections in a linear fashion.
        FreeStyle even lets you go back and forth between thinking
        linearly and thinking in terms of patterns.<font size="3"><br>

            overhang measure. This makes it possible to record notes
            into a section even if they occur before the downbeat of bar
            1, or after what would normally be considered the last bar
            of the section. The pickup and overhang measures are part of
            the section: they go with the section wherever the section
            goes. But the best part is that they don't get in the way.
            For example, when you work with sections in a song, a four
            bar section is still a four bar section, even if it has a
            few pickup notes.<font size="3"><br>

        </font><font size="2">Creating a song is easy. Just choose New
          Song from the Song menu. FreeStyle asks you to name it. After
          you do so and click OK, the song appears in the Arrangement
          window, as well as the Graphic Editing/Notation window. It is
          ready for you to place sections into it.<font size="3"><br>

        </font><font size="2">To add sections to the song, drag them
          from the Section list on left into the grid on the right. You
          can add the same section as many times as you want. For
          example, the chorus section may appear four times in your
          song. So just drag it from the Section list into the grid four
          times and place the four copies where they should go. The four
          copies are called "instances" of the original section. If you
          change the original, they all change, too. This doesn't have
          to be the case, though. If you want to make a copy that is
          different, use the Duplicate Section command to make a copy of
          the original, and then modify the duplicate section.<br>
        </font>You can freely drag sections around in the Arrangement
        grid. Place sections in any row you wish; sections placed above
        or below one another play at the same time. If you place a
        section between two other back-to-back sections, FreeStyle
        automatically moves them to squeeze in the new section. Sections
        in the same row cannot overlap. To overlap them, place them in
        different rows.<br>
        If one of your sections has tempo, meter or key changes in it
        (see the index for further information on these topics), and you
        would like your song to follow them, put the section in the top
        row of the Arrangement grid (called the "song structure row").
        All other sections placed below it in the grid will follow it,
        too.<font size="3"><br>

            you see all of its sections at once. Remember, sections in

            the time line, and their boundaries are indicated in the
            note grid by heavy vertical lines. In the Notation view,
            their names appear above each staff system. While viewing a

              Creating tempo maps</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">A tempo map consists of a series of
          changing tempos. The tempo changes can be sudden, from one
          constant tempo to another (such as an immediate change from
          102 beats per minute to 136 bpm). Or they can consist of a
          series of continuously changing tempos over time. You can even
          create rubato tempo maps that change as often and freely as
          you like. FreeStyle lets you create, modify and play back as
          many different tempo maps as you like for your song, and you
          can freely switch between them at any time.<br>
        </font><br>
        There are several ways to create a tempo map in FreeStyle:<br>
        1. Draw tempo changes with the pencil tool (and other drawing
        tools) in FreeStyle's Graphic Editing view.<br>
        2. Record FreeStyle's tempo slider during playback.<br>
        3. Import a MIDI file that contains a tempo map.<br>
        4. Record a tempo map that you play into FreeStyle using
        FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature.<br>
        5. Use one of FreeStyle's beat adjustment features (Identify
        Beats, Record Beats, or Adjust Beats), which generate a tempo
        map during the process of making FreeStyle's beats and bar lines
        match a MIDI performance that was recorded without a metronome.<br>
        These methods are discussed in the following sections. Once you
        create a tempo map, you can make your music follow it by
        choosing either the Variable or % Variable tempo mode in the
        Control Palette.<font size="3"><br>

          choose Controllers from the View menu, and then choose Tempo
          from the Type menu below the controllers editor view. You may
          then use the drawing tools to draw in tempos. When you
          manually make a change to the tempo map in this way, your
          music will play slower or faster according to the tempos you
          enter.<br>
        </font>To enter a constant tempo over a region, select the area
        with the I-beam tool and type a tempo into the tempo field below
        the graph. If you would like to express the tempo with a
        duration other than a quarter note, use the note button provided
        next to the beat per minute value. When you press return to
        enter the constant tempo, it will take effect over the entire
        selected area. To enter a constant tempo for the entire section
        (or song), select any portion of tempos (the exact selection
        doesn't matter) and then choose Select All from the Edit menu to
        select the entire tempo map. (If you don't select some tempos
        with the I-beam tool before choosing Select All, it will select
        notes instead of tempo controllers.)<br>
        To hear the results of the changes you make to the tempo map,
        set the tempo mode pop-up menu in the Control Palette to
        Variable or % Variable before you start playback.<font size="3"><br>

                Initially, each tempo map contains a single tempo event

                equivalent to quarter note = 120.00 bpm. So until you

                Variable tempo mode will not cause any variation in
                tempo. To create a tempo map, you can use any of the

                for Verse 1. You can freely switch between them by
                choosing their names in this menu. The actual tempo data
                for the currently active tempo map is shown in the
                Controller pane in the Graphic Editing window.When you

                new tempos in the section.<br>
                Another way to create tempo maps is FreeStyle's Sense
                Tempo feature. When you use Sense Tempo to record a
                take, a new tempo map appears in the tempo source menu
                with a name that associates it with that take (such as

                </font><font size="2">When you are viewing a song (which
                  you created in the Arrangement Window), the possible
                  tempo maps in the Tempo Source menu are called Song
                  Maps. A Song Map is a tempo map that is created by
                  FreeStyle by piecing together the current tempo map
                  for each section that appears in the top row of the
                  arrangement window. Since the arrangement might change
                  at any time (you might add sections, or edit the
                  current tempo map for a section) the current Song Map
                  will be updated whenever a change is made to the
                  arrangement. Therefore, if you make manual edits
                  directly to a Song Map, you should duplicate it so
                  your edits will not be lost when the program
                  automatically rebuilds the Song Map (with the next
                  arrangement change). For this reason, it is generally
                  a better idea to make all tempo edits to sections,
                  rather than songs.<br>

              which will receive the beat, and could be a different
              duration than the denominator of the time signature. For
              example, you may wish to beat dotted quarter notes in 6/8
              time.<font size="3"><br>

            <font size="2">Clicking this box will set the meter, beat
              and measure fields to values that correspond to the
              current time position of FreeStyle's playback wiper. If
              you leave the Change Meter window open while playing or
              scrubbing the sequence, these values will then update as
              time changes. This feature is simply a convenience for
              entering values in this window or for examining the beat
              values of existing meter changes.<font size="3"><br>

                The range options</font></b><br>
            <font size="2">Choose the range of measures you want to
              change here. The number of measures may change as a result
              of the Change Meter operation, depending on the options
              you choose, and the relationship between the original and
              new meters. For example, if you select two measures of 4/4
              and change them to 2/4, you'll end up with four measures
              of 2/4 (assuming that the Scale music to new beat option
              is turned off).<font size="3"><br>
              </font></font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
                Preserve tempo of beat</font></b><br>
            <font size="2">Select this option if you want the tempo of
              the beat to remain constant from the previous meter to the
              meter change you are inserting. For example, if the
              previous bar was 4/4 beating quarter notes and you are
              adding a meter change at this bar for 6/8 beating dotted
              quarter notes, then 'Preserve tempo of beat' means you
              want a dotted quarter note in the new meter to play as
              fast as a quarter did in the old meter.<br>
            </font>This option is turned on by default because it is
            usually what you want when changing the meter from 4/4 to
            6/8 (or 12/8), and vice versa.<font size="3"><br>
            </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
                Scale music to new beat</font></b><br>
            <font size="2">This option does something only if the note
              value receiving the beat in the previous meter differs
              from the note value receiving the beat in the new meter
              change you are inserting. If the note values receiving the
              beat differ, then this option adjusts the durations of all
              notes in the measures effected by the meter change
              according to the ratio of the old beat value to the new
              beat value.<br>
            </font>For example, if you had one measure of 4/4 beating
            quarters, and the notes in this measure were all triplet 8th
            notes, and you were changing the meter in this measure to
            6/8 beating dotted quarters, then the triplet 8th notes
            would become two 6/8 measures full of straight 8th notes.<br>
            This option is useful for when you have recorded 6/8
            material into FreeStyle while FreeStyle was set for 4/4
            beating quarter notes, and you would like to change all of
            the triplet 8ths to straight 8ths with the correct time
            signature.<font size="3"><br>

            </font><font size="2">The following sequence of topics
              provides basic information about FreeStyle's Step
              Recording features. See "Tutorial: Step Recording"</font>
            for a Step Recording Tutorial.<br>
            Step Recording is the process of entering notes and chords
            into FreeStyle one at a time from either your computer
            keyboard or your MIDI instrument. For example, if you were
            so inclined, you could enter Beethoven's entire Ninth
            Symphony from your computer keyboard! But Step Recording is
            great for many everyday tasks, too. It's ideal for entering
            passages that are too complicated for you to play in real
            time on your instrument (can you play a septuplet run?).
            It's also great for entering music when you don't have a
            MIDI instrument handy. FreeStyle's new event list window is
            packed full of innovative step-recording features that allow
            you to accomplish all of these things.<font size="3"><br>

            </font><font size="2">FreeStyle offers a unique feature
              called Visual Step Record, which lets you actually see the
              notes you are about to insert on your computer screen -
              but before you actually insert them. To turn on this
              feature, check the 'Insert from MIDI Keyboard option'.
              Here's an example of how it works. Let's say that you are
              entering some sheet music into FreeStyle, but you're not
              that great at reading sheet music. You see a chord on the
              page that you want to enter into FreeStyle. You press the
              keys on your MIDI keyboard that you think are the right
              ones. As you hold them down, FreeStyle writes the chord on
              screen. But you see immediately that it doesn't match your
              sheet music. You then try a few other keys, while
              FreeStyle dynamically updates the chord on the screen. You
              can keep experimenting until the chord in FreeStyle
              matches the chord written on your sheet music. Then you
              can permanently insert the chord, once you've got it
              right. FreeStyle is ideal for this kind of interactive
              step-recording because it dynamically updates the display
              of what you are entering as you enter it.<font size="3"><br>

                </font><font size="2">The Step Controls let you insert
                  notes using your computer mouse and keyboard. If you
                  check the Insert from MIDI keyboard option, you can
                  also choose the pitches of notes and chords from your
                  MIDI keyboard. If you also check the Advance One Step
                  on Insert option, you can actually insert each note
                  and chord from your MIDI keyboard as soon as you lift
                  your finger(s) from each note or chord. For example,
                  with these two options checked, you can enter a run of
                  sixteenth notes by simply playing the notes, at your
                  leisure, one at a time on your keyboard. Just be sure
                  to release one note before you play the next.
                  Otherwise, you may get a chord of two notes together,
                  rather than two separate notes. One helpful technique
                  is to "peck" at the notes when step recording them, to
                  insure proper separation between each note. Remember,
                  you don't have to worry about the duration you play
                  because the duration is set by the Duration __% of
                  Step option for the note.<font size="3"><br>

                    recording. For example, many sources of published
                    MIDI music use a standard of 480 ppq or 240 ppq when
                    printing lists of MIDI data. Or perhaps you use
                    Performer, and you are used to thinking in terms of
                    480 ppq. Or maybe you would simply find it more
                    convenient to type "96" rather than "960" all the

                    the left, it is being displayed and entered with 960
                    ticks per quarter note. On the right, it is being
                    displayed with 48 ticks per quarter note. Notice
                    that the Start and End times of the notes are the
                    same. This tells us that the number of ticks per

                    it has no effect on their actual location. FreeStyle

          size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">As mentioned earlier, FreeStyle's notation
          view updates dynamically as you step record. For example, if
          you turn off the Advance One Step on Insert option, you can
          watch notes appear and disappear on the screen as you
          experiment with the note or chord you would like to enter
          next. As you do so, there may be times, especially on a grand
          staff, when the notation display might not look quite the way
          you would expect. This is most often because FreeStyle's
          transcription engine hasn't had the benefit of seeing what you
          will enter next. Usually, by the time you finish an entire
          measure, the transcription will look fine. If the
          hand-splitting on the grand staff is not quite what you want,
          you can always tweak it later with the <u>Switch Staff</u></font>
        command in the Region menu.<font size="3"><br>

              Using the keypad to choose step durations</font></span></b><font
          size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">The keypad on the right-hand side of your
          computer keyboard lets you choose step durations. This can
          especially help speed up note insertion from your MIDI
          keyboard, as you can have one hand on your MIDI keyboard and
          the other on the keypad. Below is a diagram showing what each
          key does on the keypad.<br>
        </font>Note that the Event List window must be the front-most
        window for these assignments to be active.<br>

              Doubling or halving a note's duration with the + / -
              keypad keys</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">The Event List window lets you use the +
          and - (plus and minus) keys on your computer keypad to
          increase or decrease a note's duration. To do so, simply
          select the note in the Event List and then press the plus or
          minus key on your keypad. The plus key doubles the duration;
          the minus key halves it.<br>
        </font>Note: the Event List must be the front-most window for
        this to work. To apply the same technique to two or more notes
        at one time, select them.<br>
        If you work with FreeStyle's notation view, here is something to
        keep in mind when using the plus/minus keys to change durations.
        The notation view may not always reflect the changes you've made
        to the durations of the notes. For example, if you have a single
        note in a measure, and you keep halving its duration, it may not
        notate any smaller than an eighth note, even though its duration
        gets as short as 120 ppq. However, if other notes are placed
        around it, its short 120-tick duration may cause it to
        re-transcribe as a 16th or 32nd note, for example. As you can
        see, results will vary, depending on the complete musical
        context in the measure.<br>

            </font>Use the Insert Page Number/Insert Part Name commands
            to insert special text that changes according to what you

            visible player when you are viewing only a single player.
            When you are viewing multiple players, the part name is
            "Score". You must use the text tool to create a text box
            before you choose "Insert Page Number" or "Insert Part
            Name". These commands insert text into an existing text box.
            FreeStyle will not let you select just part of a page number
            or part name, but otherwise these bits of text act just like
            any other word in a text box. You can cut, copy, paste or
            delete them, and change their font, size, and style just as

                Changing the staff size</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">There are two ways to affect the size of
            the music that FreeStyle will print. If you use the staff
            size setting in the Page Layout dialog, FreeStyle will show
            you the page the way it would print. This method affects
            only the size of your music, leaving staff names and other
            text unchanged. Since your printer probably has higher
            resolution than your computer monitor, you may choose a
            staff size that is too small to view comfortably on your
            screen. If so, you can use the zoom setting in the lower
            left of the Notation View to zoom in on the staves.<br>
          </font>The other way to change the size of the printed music
          is to choose a scaling setting in the Print Setup command
          Options dialog box. If you want everything to be 80% of normal
          size, type in 80%. Since the size of the paper in your printer
          doesn't change, FreeStyle changes the size of the white page
          area in the notation display so that after scaling, it will
          correspond to the actual page size. This method scales
          everything that FreeStyle prints, so all text, section names,
          measure numbers, etc. will come out at 80% of normal size.
          Also any text you've placed on the page in a specific relation
          to the margins will probably need to be repositioned after you
          change the scaling amount.<font size="3"><br>

            the only aspect of your page layout that is the same for
            parts and scores. The piano setting in the clef pop-up menu
            gives the player two staves, with bass and treble clefs. All
            the other choices result in a single staff for the player.
            The ledger line settings in the window control how much
            space is needed around this player's staff or staves,
            expressed as a number of ledger lines (equal to the space
            between two staff lines). When working with a two-staff
            player ("Piano" clef), the setting called ledger lines
            between controls how much space appears between the player's
            two staves.<font size="3"><br>

                    Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
              </font><font size="2">The word "controller" is shorthand
                for the MIDI term "continuous controller data", which is
                a type of MIDI information. Continuous controllers are
                used to add musical effects that change smoothly over
                time, such as volume changes (crescendos &amp;
                decrescendos), amount of vibrato (which often increases
                in intensity over the duration of a note), and pitch
                bend to name a few. There are over a hundred types of
                controllers, although only about 30 are commonly used.
                In most cases, controllers affect whatever notes are
                playing at the time that they occur. In addition, they
                usually consist of a stream of individual data events
                that change their value over time. For example, a
                crescendo that occurs over the period of one bar might
                actually consist of 50 or 60 individual volume control
                MIDI events spaced only a few fractions of a second
                apart. In addition, each one has a value that is a
                little higher than the one before it (controllers have a
                value range from 0 to 127). To our ears, the net effect
                sounds like a smooth crescendo.<br>
              </font>Since Controllers have this dual nature (individual
              events that constitute a smooth gesture) FreeStyle
              displays them in a way that lets you see where each event
              is, as well as the overall shape. Whenever you see a
              bracket in the controller view it indicates that there is
              a single event in effect for the entire duration of the
              bracket.<br>
              Note velocities (the "velocity" of a note determines how
              loud it is) are the one exception to the way that
              controllers are displayed. Since there is only one
              velocity setting for each note, they are drawn as vertical
              bars, rather than as a connected shape.<font size="3"><br>

              then choose Controllers from the View menu, or press Ctrl

              you can draw a single controller by clicking once with the

              smooth curve by dragging the pencil, line, and curve
              tools. When inserting controllers, you do so for one
              player at a time: the currently record-enabled player. So

                  FreeStyle is intelligent about editing controllers
                  with notes</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">Many sequencers treat notes and
              controllers completely separately, and they leave it up to
              you to remember to edit the controllers after you edit the
              notes they affect. For example, if you copy some notes
              that also have a crescendo, you'd need to remember to copy
              and paste the crescendo after doing so with the notes.<br>
            </font>FreeStyle helps you out by automatically selecting
            controllers when you select notes by dragging a selection
            box over them. When you copy or modify the notes, the
            controller information will come along for the ride.
            FreeStyle decides whether or not to auto-select the
            controller information based on the amount of overlap that
            the selected notes have with the other notes around them.
            Since there are times when FreeStyle may not select
            controllers you want it to, or may select ones you don't,
            you should keep the controllers view open if you are not
            sure what is happening. Also, if you find that you do not
            like the decisions that FreeStyle makes about when to select
            controllers, there is a preference to turn auto selection
            off.<br>
            FreeStyle also gives you a hand when it comes to pasting
            controllers. In other sequencers, when you paste controller
            information on top of other controller information, the
            events are simply merged together. This almost always yields
            horrible sounding results. FreeStyle takes a more
            intelligent approach. It looks at the controllers that are
            being merged together, and if there is a conflict it only
            keeps the controllers you are pasting. What you are pasting
            always takes precedence over the destination. In this way
            the notes that you paste will sound the same as when they
            were copied. (You can reverse this behavior by checking the
            "keep destination controllers" preference.) <br>

                Playback loops</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">There are two kinds of loops that you
            can use in FreeStyle. A Record Loop causes time to cycle
            between two points. Whenever the end of a record loop is
            reached, the time wiper jumps back to the beginning of the
            loop and all players start playing whatever notes they have
            recorded at that time. A record loop is merely a convenience
            for recording notes repeatedly over the same section of
            time.<br>
          </font>A playback loop, on the other hand, does not affect the
          passage of time at all. It affects the performance of a <b>single















































































            take by a single player in a single section</b> of music.
          When you create a playback loop for a take, you are asking
          FreeStyle to repeat one or more bars of the take for some
          number of times. For example, you could record one bar of a
          drum groove and create a playback loop which would cause that
          one bar to repeat four times, or until the end of the section.
          But while the drum notes are repeating, the time wiper will
          continue to move forward normally so other players can play
          normally. If the piano player does not have a playback loop,
          then when the wiper is in bar 4 the piano will be playing the
          notes that it has in bar 4, but the drummer will be playing
          the third repeat of the notes that it has in bar 1.<font

            size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">Using a playback loop has a few
            benefits. First, it saves time. You don't have to copy and
            paste your one bar of drum notes many times to get the
            effect you want. Secondly, it saves memory in the computer.
            It takes less space to store one bar of notes with the
            directions to repeat those notes ten times than it does to
            store ten identical copies of the notes. Thirdly, it's
            convenient to edit. When you change a note that is part of a
            playback loop, the note will change for all repeats of the
            note as well.<font size="3"><br>

            </font><font size="2">FreeStyle has an extra feature for
              playback loops called loop overrides. Loop overrides make
              it possible for you to make changes to measures within a
              playback loop without affecting the other repeating
              measures in the loop. For example, suppose you have a
              1-bar drum pattern that is looping throughout your entire
              chorus. If you want to add a couple of fills here and
              there but leave the rest of the loop intact, you can just
              override the loop for the bars you want to change. In
              fact, if you just want to overdub your changes on top of
              the existing loop, FreeStyle will automatically make loop
              overrides for the measures that you record on top of.<font

                    Using playback loops to build a drum part</font></span></b><font

              </font><font size="2">Here is an excellent approach for
                developing a drum part. Start by using a Riff Metronome
                so you have a drum beat to play to while you record your
                other parts. When the rest of your music is in place and
                you want to finalize your drum part, use the Become
                Player button in the Metronome dialog to convert your
                Riff Metronome into an editable drum player. For
                sections that are longer than the metronome riff, the
                Become Player button will create a playback loop for the
                new drum player's current take which will repeat the
                drum riff until the end of the section. Next, override
                just the drum measures you want to change using one of
                the methods described below. Change the notes in the
                overridden measures, and you're done!<br>
              </font>Here are some other things to keep in mind when
              using playback loops: The markers that show playback loop
              definitions appear only in the graphic editing view's time
              line. They aren't visible in the notation view. In the
              graphic editing view, original notes appear with rounded
              edges and repeated notes appear with square edges. In the
              notation view, repeated notes are indistinguishable from
              original notes. <font size="3"><br>

                of the loop will receive the new notes and no override
                will be created. If you play into a repeat bar of the

            </font><font size="2">To delete a playback loop override
              within an existing playback loop, first select the take
              that contains the loop and show only that take's player in
              the graphic editing view. Playback loop markers will
              appear in the time line. Click on the override marker in
              the measure that you wish to revert and press the delete
              key to delete the override. When the override is removed,
              the take will revert to playing and showing ghosts of the
              original looping notes (with square edges). It is
              important to note that deleting an override does not
              delete whatever extra notes were recorded within the
              override. If you override the measure again, those notes
              will appear again. If you want the notes in your override
              to be deleted as well, select them and delete them before
              you delete the override marker. <br>
            </font>When you add a playback loop to a take which contains
            existing notes beyond the end of the loop source, the
            playback loop will act like an opaque layer on top of
            whatever notes were previously recorded. Repeating notes
            will temporarily obscure whatever used to be in the repeat
            bars until the playback loop is removed -- at which time the
            old notes will become visible again. When you override a
            playback loop in a given measure, it is like cutting a hole
            in the opaque layer and looking through to the raw take
            underneath. Hence, if you add a playback loop to a take
            which obscures a group of old notes, you may be surprised to
            find them popping up in your override measures. To avoid
            this, delete unwanted notes from a take before adding a
            playback loop.<font size="3"><br>

              a metronome while you record. Recording with the metronome
              is important because it ensures that FreeStyle's measures
              and beats properly match what you play. You have three
              choices for a metronome sound: a standard click sound on
              the computer's internal speaker, a MIDI click produced by
              one of your MIDI instruments, such as a side stick sound
              on a drum machine or drum kit, or FreeStyle's "Riff
              Metronome".<br>
            </font>FreeStyle's metronome riffs are set up for a General
            MIDI drum kit. If necessary, you can adjust them for a
            non-GM device. Just open them in FreeStyle (using Open in
            the File menu), edit the notes, and save again as a standard
            MIDI file in the FREESTYL\METRONOM directory. To get rid of
            a riff entirely, remove it from the directory.<font size="3"><br>

              </font><font size="2">FreeStyle's "riff" metronome is
                probably one of the most musical metronomes you've ever
                encountered. A riff can be any musical phrase you want.
                FreeStyle provides a list of stock drum loops as riffs,
                but you can make your own riffs out of anything, such as
                a bass part or keyboard lick. To use a riff, choose it
                from the pop-up menu as shown below. To add your own
                riff to the menu, either save it into FreeStyle's
                metronom directory as a standard MIDI file using the
                Save As command, or select anything you've recorded into
                FreeStyle and use the Save As Metronome command in the
                Region menu. Then start jamming. Once you've got some
                ideas down, you can convert the metronome riff into a
                player using the Become Player button below to fine-tune

              Remote controls let you control all of FreeStyle's
              transport controls and recording features from your MIDI
              keyboard. They are designed so that you can record an
              entire song from start to finish without ever touching
              your computer. You can assign a FreeStyle command to any
              key on your MIDI keyboard. In order to use the key as a
              remote control, you first hold down a command trigger so
              FreeStyle knows you are not just playing a note. The
              trigger can be a single controller, such as a foot pedal,
              or it can be a "clump" of keys that you would never want
              to play simultaneously while recording. You can smoothly
              switch between recording and "remote controlling"
              FreeStyle by pressing and releasing the trigger keys.<font

          the clipboard until you copy something else. You can copy any
          selection of notes and controllers, even if there is more than
          one Player involved. This lets you move entire stretches of
          music in a single operation.<br>
        </font>When you copy notes that are in a playback loop, only the
        source notes are copied to the clipboard; the notes generated by
        the playback loop (i.e. the notes in the playback loop with the
        squared-off edges) do not copy.<br>
        When you copy while viewing a song, a copy of the selection will
        be placed on the clipboard for each instance of its section in
        the current song. For example if I have put five copies of
        "Chorus" in my song, and I copy some music from "Chorus" I will
        wind up with five repetitions of the events on the clipboard.
        This may or may not be what you intended. In general it is less

            determine where the music gets pasted. By default, FreeStyle
            places the music in the same measure that the wiper is in
            and maintains the relationship the music originally had with
            the bar line. In other words, if the music you copied
            started on beat three of the measure it was in, then it will
            be placed at beat three of whatever measure the wiper is in.
            This is called "measure-relative" pasting, and it makes
            copying and pasting quick and easy. It lets you quickly
            duplicate chunks of music without needing to precisely
            position the wiper.<br>
          </font>In some situations, you may prefer to have more control
          over the exact location where the music is placed. If you
          un-check "Paste measure relative" in the General section of
          the Preferences dialog, FreeStyle will paste relative to the
          current brush/cursor grid setting, rather than the bar line.
          For example, if you copied a note that began on beat three
          plus a sixteenth note, then pasted with a grid setting of one
          quarter note with the wiper near beat two, the note would be
          placed at beat two plus a sixteenth note, thus maintaining its
          original relationship to a quarter note grid.<br>

            to do an automatic instrument transposition in the notation
            view whenever a player of that type is displayed by itself.
            For example, choose "Edit Player Library" from the "Player
            Library" sub-menu in the Setup menu. Choose "Clarinet" from
            the "Player Library Entry" popup menu at the top of the
            dialog. In the box within the dialog labelled "Notation",
            you will see that "Transpose Part" has been set to B flat.
            This is because a clarinet is a B flat instrument. A
            Clarinet part played in the concert key of C will be
            transposed up a full step to the key of D when the part is
            displayed or printed by itself. This type of transposition
            does not affect the pitch of a player at all, only the way
            that it is notated.<font size="3"><br>

          notes and use the Transpose palette. To make the Transpose
          palette appear, choose "Transpose" from the Region menu.
          Adjust the settings in the window and click the Transpose
          button to offset the pitches of all selected notes by the
          desired amount. If you don't have any notes selected, the

          but the notation view doesn't know what key you want. To fix
          this, click on the treble or bass clef symbol at the left edge
          of any staff (you'll know you're in the right place when the
          cursor changes to a '#/b' symbol). A popup menu of all the
          possible key signatures will appear. Choose the appropriate
          key signature and the notation view will update its
          transcription of your recording. You can also use the Change
          Key command in the Song menu to accomplish the same thing.<font

          you're in the right place when the cursor changes to a '#/b'
          symbol.) Click the barline with the "#/b" cursor and choose
          the desired key from the pop-up menu. You can also enter a key

        </font>There are two ways to do this. One is to use the Change
        Key command in the Song menu. The Change Key dialog has a check
        box called Transpose Notes. When it is checked, FreeStyle
        transposes all notes affected by the key change. If you have a
        drum player, however, you should use the Transpose dialog to
        restore the drum notes back to their original pitches.<br>
        The other approach is a simple, two-step operation: first change
        the key and then transpose the notes. See the two previous help
        topics for how to do each step. Of course, if you are only
        working in the graphic editing view you don't have to bother
        changing the key signature until you want to display or print

        </font><font size="2">When you transpose your music by any of
          these methods, FreeStyle is very good about choosing how to
          spell the notes. It takes many factors into account, including
          the pitch of the note, the key signature, the mode (major or
          minor), and even the musical context of the note. For example,
          is the note in an ascending melodic line? If so, FreeStyle
          will tend to use a sharp instead of a flat. You can, at any
          time, override FreeStyle's choice for a note spelling by
          double-clicking the note and choosing a different spelling in
          the Note Detail dialog. For complete details about note
          spelling, see the 'Note Spellings' topic.<font size="3"><br>

              Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">Players are one of FreeStyle's fundamental
          building blocks. A player has a lot of control over its music,
          from how it sounds to how it is displayed in the notation
          view. Since it would be tedious to set up all this information
          each time you create a new player FreeStyle gives you a
          powerful short-cut: The Player Library. The player library
          stores commonly used "Forms" or "Templates" that you can use
          to create Players from.<br>
        </font>You can think of a Player Template as a "Rubber Stamp"
        for creating Players. Extending the metaphor, if you modify a
        rubber stamp, it does not affect "prints" that have already been
        made with it, only the ones it will make in the future. If you
        modify a print, it does not change the stamp, or any other
        prints. Player Templates work the same way. Changing a Player
        Template does not affect Players that have already been made,
        only ones that you make from that point forward. Similarly,
        modifying a Player, either in the Ensemble window, or in the
        "Edit Player Info" dialog does not affect the Player Template it
        was created from, or Players in other documents.<br>
        To summarize, a Player Template is a "stamp" that you can use to
        create a Player. After the Player is created it is no longer
        tied to the Template that created it in any way.<font size="3"><br>

        </font><font size="2">Resist the temptation to create one player
          template for each sound on your MIDI device. Instead, think of
          a player template as a category of instrument, such as brass,
          or even a more specific classification, such as piano. Player
          templates are useful for making players that are more or less
          what you're after. No doubt once a player is created you will
          want to refine it to suit your piece. For example you should
          probably only have one "Piano" player template that can be
          used to create players that will actually become grand piano,
          honky tonk piano, or harpsichord. On the other hand, if you
          are constantly using a Fender Rhodes keyboard sound, then it
          would, for convenience sake, make sense to add a Fender Rhodes
          player template. It's up to you to create a Player Library
          that fits the way you work.<font size="3"><br>

          players created from this template will be notated when viewed
          in an instrument part (individually). It does not change the
          way the Players will sound. Enter the standard transposition
          for the instrument you are describing. For example, you would
          enter Bb for a Bb Clarinet. (The up/down pop-up menu has no
          effect if zero octaves is entered.) For Baritone Sax you would
          enter Eb and 1 octave up, since it is notated one octave and a
          major sixth above concert pitch.<font size="3"><br>

        <font size="2">The score transposition settings affect how
          players created from this template will be notated when viewed
          in a score (with other players). The default score
          transposition is C natural (concert pitch). But you might want
          to change it. For example, bass parts often end up with too
          many ledger lines below the staff. You could set the score
          (and part) transposition up an octave to make the part easier
          to read. Here's another example: if you prefer to see
          instruments in their transposed form in the score (instead of
          in concert pitch), you can set the score transposition to
          match the part transposition.<br>

          to re-enter all your player settings every time you created a
          player, it would be annoying to have to add your favorite
          players one at a time to each new document. FreeStyle has a
          short-cut: The Ensemble Library.<br>
        </font>An Ensemble Library Entry is a collection of player
        templates that can be added to a document in one shot. Whenever
        you create a document, FreeStyle asks you to pick an ensemble
        library entry. It then creates players from each of the player

            The Choose Notes command lets you highlight notes

            from a current selection (unhighlight them) based on these
            same characteristics.<br>
          </font>You can use the Choose Notes command with or without
          notes already selected, depending on what you would like to
          do. If you start with notes already selected, Choose Notes
          lets you select more notes, or selectively unhighlight some of
          the already selected notes. For example, you could select all
          the notes in your chorus section (with the Select All
          command), and then use Choose Notes to deselect all of the
          notes that have a duration of a sixteenth note or less.<br>
          <img data="bm34.jpg" title="bm34.jpg"><br>
          In the example above, Choose Notes is targeting all notes
          between C3 and C4 that are located within measure 1, beat 3
          and measure 5, beat 3 with durations between a sixteenth and
          an 8th note and velocities between 80 and 110. You could
          select them by clicking the Add button or deselect them by
          clicking Remove.The Remove and Add buttons allow you to make
          multiple additions and omissions from the currently selected
          notes before you click OK to exit the dialog. For example, you
          could first add all notes with durations longer than a quarter
          note and then remove all notes with velocities over 100. You
          can use the Add and Remove buttons as many times as you like
          before you click OK. This allows you to make your selection
          criteria as detailed and complicated as you like.<font

              A note spelling is the pitch and accidental used in the

              allows you to manually override the choices it makes for
              note spellings in the Note Detail dialog, which you can

              musical context, key signature and mode (major or minor).

            <font size="2">The in-depth analysis that FreeStyle performs
              on your music to spell notes correctly takes time. If you
              have a slower computer, you can speed up the time it takes
              FreeStyle to draw notation by turning off Smart Note
              Spellings for the current document in the Notation
              sub-menu of the Setup menu. If you would also like this
              option to be disabled in all newly created documents,
              uncheck the Smart Note Spellings option in the Notation
              Preferences dialog (which can be opened by choosing
              Preferences from the Edit menu). When the Smart Note
              Spellings option is turned off, FreeStyle still spells
              notes correctly according to the current key signature and
              mode (major or minor), but it does not analyze the musical
              context of the note. In most cases, FreeStyle's choices
              for note spelling are still quite acceptable, and you can
              always manually tweak individual note spellings. (The
              'Auto' option means that FreeStyle will choose the
              spelling.)<br>
            </font>If, however, you prefer the way notes are spelled
            with Smart Note Spellings turned on, you can leave it turned
            off while you are recording, editing and mixing your music
            in order to take advantage of the improved responsiveness.
            Then, right before you print your notation, you can turn
            Smart Note Spellings back on.<font size="3"><br>

              Normally, FreeStyle dynamically manages the MIDI channel
              assignments of the players in your ensemble so you don't
              have to think about such technical details. You simply
              choose a sound in your synthesizer (such as 'Honky Tonk
              Piano') for a player in the Ensemble palette sound pop-up
              menu. FreeStyle knows all about the sounds in your
              synthesizer and knows what MIDI channels each sound can
              play on, so FreeStyle then automatically assigns the
              player to an eligible MIDI channel in the instrument.
              FreeStyle may even borrow other MIDI channels on the fly
              during playback, if necessary, if the MIDI instrument
              wouldn't otherwise be able to play all the notes. All of
              this goes on 'under the hood' so you don't have to worry
              about it.<br>
            </font>There may be times, however, when you want to take
            control over the MIDI channel assignments of your players.
            For example, you may have an instrument that does not lend
            itself to FreeStyle's dynamic channel allocation. In cases
            like this, FreeStyle allows you to specify a desired MIDI
            channel for the sound that a player uses rather than doing
            so automatically for you.When you check the 'Lock Player
            Channels in Ensemble Window' option in the General
            Preferences window (opened from the Edit menu), a Channel
            column appears in the Ensemble window as shown. Selecting a
            channel for a player forces FreeStyle to use the selected
            channel for playing that sound. No other player may lock to
            the same channel on the same device. For more information on
            channel locking, see <u>Sound Changes</u> and <u>Layered

        </font><font size="2">A layered sound is when a single player
          plays a blend of two or more sounds at the same time. For
          example, the player might be set up to play a pan flute sound
          on one MIDI instrument, while at the same time playing a muted
          trumpet sound on another MIDI instrument. The result sounds
          like the two instruments are playing in unison with one
          another.<br>
        </font>FreeStyle lets you create your own layered sounds using
        the sounds provided by your MIDI instruments. You can include as
        many individual sounds as you want in a layered sound. Each
        layer can even have its own volume and pan settings. You can
        also lock individual layers to a specific MIDI channel, if
        necessary. (For complete information about channel locking, see
        <u>Locking player MIDI channels</u>.)<br>
        Once you've created your own layered sounds, they appear under
        the Layered Sounds item when you click in the Sound column in

            A shortcut for creating layered sounds and adding layers</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">To easily add a layer to a player's current
          sound, hold down the Shift key while choosing a sound in the
          Sound column in the Ensemble palette. When the sound is
          chosen, a new layer will be automatically created for it. If
          the current sound is not a layered sound, a new layered sound
          will be created containing two layers: the original sound in
          one layer and the newly-selected sound in the other. If the
          old sound was already a layered sound, the definition for that
          sound will be altered to include the new layer, and any other
          player using that layered sound will be changed accordingly.<font

            The 'official' way to create a layered sound</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">To create and edit layered sounds, choose Edit
          Layered Sounds from the Setup menu. The Layered Sound Library
          dialog appears as shown below. If the currently record-enabled
          player is using a layered sound, that sound will be displayed.<br>
        </font><img data="bm52.jpg" title="bm52.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">If a player in the current ensemble is
          using a layered sound, edits made to that sound will be heard
          immediately. If a layered sound is deleted, any player using
          the sound will automatically be assigned to another sound
          instead.<br>
        </font>Layered Sounds are saved as part of the FreeStyle
        Libraries file (like player library entries).If a player uses a
        layered sound, the definition of that sound is also stored with
        the FreeStyle document itself, so that the document can be used
        by another FreeStyle user who doesn't have that layered sound in
        their FreeStyle Libraries yet. When the other person opens the
        document, the layered sound definition will automatically be
        added to his or her library of layered sounds.<br>
        Each layer of the layered sound is displayed separately in its
        own panel. Each layer has its own, unique sound, as well as
        unique settings for volume, pan and, if necessary, MIDI channel.<br>
        To select a layer (for deleting), click anywhere on the layer
        panel. The heavy border indicates that it is selected.<br>
        The 'Delete Layer' button gets rid of the currently selected
        layer. It is grayed out until you select a layer as described
        above.<br>
        Click 'New' to create a new layered sound. The new layered sound
        will have two layers. To add more layers, use the 'Add Layer'
        button. To view and edit an existing layered sound, choose it
        from the menu at the top of the window.<br>
        The volume and pan settings for a layer are relative to the
        other layers. The overall volume and pan are still controlled by
        the Player's volume and pan settings in the Ensemble palette, or
        by volume and pan continuous controller data.<br>
        Use the buttons at the bottom to rename, delete or duplicate the
        current layered sound (as indicated by the menu at the top of
        the window).<font size="3"><br>

            specific channels may not always be able to get the channels
            they desire. If, for example, Layered Sound 1 locks one of

            then select Layered Sound 1, only one player will actually
            get channel 4; the other player's sound will end up on a
            different channel. (For complete information about channel

              Overview</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A Sound Change is when a player changes the
            sound it is using in mid-performance. For example, if the
            Guitar player wants to use a 'distorted' sound for 8 bars
            and a 'clean' sound for the next 8, but still be considered
            (displayed, notated, etc.) as the same part, a Sound Change
            could be inserted which would select the 'clean' sound at
            the appropriate moment. Unlike conventional MIDI 'patch
            changes,' FreeStyle's Sound Changes allow the player to
            switch to a completely different device at any time to play
            its sounds. Sound Changes can even involve layered sounds.<br>
          </font><img data="bm159.jpg" title="bm159.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
          </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
              Editing Sound Changes in the Controllers Window</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">To insert a sound change, open the Controllers
            window, and select 'Sound Changes' as the type. The tools
            are the standard I-beam tool for selecting and a flag tool
            for inserting sound changes. Select the flag tool and click
            in the Controllers window at the time when the sound should
            change. A Sound Change 'flag' appears, showing the sound and
            channel of the current sound. Use the Sound menu inside the
            flag to choose the sound you would like the player to change
            to at the time location of the flag.<br>
          </font>To insert, view and edit sound changes for a player,
          display the controller pane (by choosing 'Controllers' from
          the View menu) and then choose 'Sound Changes' from the 'Type'
          menu.<br>
          When you first insert a sound change, it displays the current
          sound for the player. Choose the sound you want from the Sound
          menu inside the sound change flag.<br>
          Use the I-beam and flag tools to select and insert sound
          changes (respectively).<br>
          If you drag horizontally with the Flag tool, two Sound Change
          flags are inserted: one at the start and one at the end of the
          region you've dragged. This is useful if you would like to
          change the sound and then change it back sometime later. Any
          existing Sound Changes within the region you dragged over are
          removed.<br>
          To delete a sound change, click the flag to select it (the
          'flagpole' appears hollow) and use the Cut command (or press
          the delete key). You can shift-click to select more than one
          Sound Change flag. Alternatively, you can use the I-Beam tool
          to select all of the sound changes in a region.<font size="3"><br>

              Sound Changes and the Ensemble palette</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">The Ensemble palette always shows the current
            sound for a player. When a Sound Change occurs, the Ensemble
            palette updates to reflect the new sound and channel for the
            player that changed. Also, selecting a sound or channel in
            the Ensemble palette alters the most recently-occurring
            sound change. To alter a player's default sound, the
            playback wiper must be placed before any Sound Changes.<font

            sound to a device and channel, no other player can lock to
            that channel, even if the locked sound is not currently
            active.<font size="3"><br>

        </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
            What is beat adjustment?</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">Beat Adjustment is when you tell FreeStyle where
          the beats are in a musical performance that for some reason
          does not match FreeStyle's beats and barlines. This situation
          would arise, for example, if you turned off FreeStyle's
          metronome and then recorded a piece of music without
          FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature. While FreeStyle counts away
          internally at a straight 120 beats per minute, you might be
          playing a free-flowing rubato performance with tempos around
          86 beats per minute. The result is that what you record would
          not match up with FreeStyle's measure and beat counter in the
          Control palette or the measure and beat ruler in the Graphic
          Editing window. Most significantly, the transcription of your
          performance in FreeStyle's notation view will be completely
          unrecognizable because FreeStyle would try to write your music
          as if you did play along with the metronome.<br>
        </font><img data="bm9.jpg" title="bm9.jpg"><br>
        Another common situation in which this condition arises is when
        you import a standard MIDI file that contains material recorded
        in another sequencer without a metronome.FreeStyle's beat
        adjustment features give you a host of powerful tools to correct
        FreeStyle's beats. The result is that FreeStyle's counter,
        measure/beat rulers and notation transcription accurately
        reflect the measures and beats of your music. The music notation
        becomes recognizable and readable, and you can use FreeStyle's
        many features, such as Quantizing, that are based on where notes
        are in the measure. Best of all, your original performance is
        preserved; it will play exactly the same as it did before you
        performed beat adjustment.<br>
        Even if you don't use FreeStyle's notation display (or you don't
        plan to print out notation), it is still useful for FreeStyle to
        know where the beats and barlines are so that you can use
        FreeStyle's many other metrically dependent features, such as
        quantizing.<font size="3"><br>
        </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
            Your original performance is always preserved</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">The best part about beat adjustment -- and the
          most important thing to remember about it -- is: beat
          adjustment never changes the timing or the feel of your
          performance. What you hear after using FreeStyle's beat
          adjustment features will always sound exactly like what you
          originally played. FreeStyle accomplishes this by moving the
          notes around metrically but at the same time generating
          precisely calculated tempo changes placed at exactly the right
          time. FreeStyle makes sure that the combination of the new
          tempo map with the newly aligned notes, when played back,
          produces exactly the same performance as before.<br>
        </font>As you can probably tell by now, beat adjustment is not
        quantizing. Really, it's just the opposite. Quantizing moves
        note to the nearest beat (or grid location). Beat adjustment
        moves the beat (or grid location) to the nearest appropriate
        note.<br>
        Another way to think of it is this: when you drag a note in
        FreeStyle, you are changing the performance to make that note
        play at a different time. When you drag a beat line in
        FreeStyle, the performance stays the same but the notation and
        the tempo map change. It is often useful to open the controller
        window and display Tempos before beginning to adjust beats so
        you can see how FreeStyle is adjusting your tempo map as you
        drag the beat lines.<font size="3"><br>
        </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
            Switching between the music's original timing and a constant
            tempo</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">Another benefit of adjusting beats is that it
          allows you to freely switch between the music's original tempo
          and feel -- even a very rubato performance -- and a constant
          tempo. Why? Because FreeStyle's beat adjustment features
          generate a tempo map that preserves your original performance.
          You can then use the tempo modes in the Control palette to
          play your music with or without the tempo map. To hear your
          music's original tempo, timing and feel, you would choose the
          variable tempo mode. To hear your music at a constant tempo,
          you would choose constant. For a further explanation of these
          options (including % variable, which lets you hear your music
          faster or slower but with its original timing and feel), see
          'The Tempo Mode settings' on-line help topic.<font size="3"><br>

            FreeStyle provides both manual and automatic beat adjustment</font></b><br>

        <font size="2">Record beats lets you tell FreeStyle where the
          beats are in your music by tapping along with your music as it
          plays back. Since it can be difficult to precisely anticipate
          every beat consistently as you listen (especially in a rubato
          performance), you will probably find it necessary to tweak
          things with Adjust beats afterwards. Record Beats gets you 'in
          the ball park', and Adjust Beats lets you clean up the few
          beats that you may have missed slightly.<font size="3"><br>

        <font size="2">There are two ways to record beats. If the music
          begins at an odd time with no means of anticipating the first
          note, then it would be hard to tap exactly on the first note.
          In this case, choose Start button is first beat. Before
          entering the dialog, position the playback wiper to exactly
          the start time of the first note which is on the beat value
          you are going to tap. You can do this easily by
          double-clicking on the note to see its exact start time, and
          then typing those values into the counter fields in the
          control palette. To begin, choose Record Beats from the Song
          menu. Then, click the play button or press the space bar,

        <font size="2">The second way to record beats is when the first
          beat of your music happens at a location that is easy to
          anticipate. For example, you may have recorded a measure of
          clicks before the first note. If so, rewind to any point
          before the first note before choosing Record Beats from the

          whatever player you have record-enabled. But don't worry: the
          notes you are tapping will not be recorded for that player.
          They go into a special buffer which FreeStyle uses only for
          creating a tempo map and adjusting the placement of beats in
          your performance. You might want to record-enable a drum

            The 'Shift to' option</font></b><br>
        <font size="2">When you are trying to adjust the beats of a
          performance that was recorded without a metronome, in most
          cases the performance doesn't start at the correct measure and
          beat. For example, musically, the first note of the
          performance might be a pickup note that starts two beats
          before the downbeat of measure 1 (i.e. measure zero, beat 3).
          But since the performance was recorded without a metronome,
          the first note is probably located at an arbitrary place, such
          as measure 5, beat 2, tick 237.<br>
        </font>When this is the case, you can use the Shift to option to
        make the Record Beats operation move your entire performance for
        you such that it starts at the desired measure and beat. Just
        type in the desired measure and beat, and the Record Beats
        operation will put the first note at the location you indicate.<font

          difficult to tap precisely on every beat during a long

            The Identify Beats feature can be used with either the
            notation or the graphic editing views. The most common way
            to use it is to open the notation view, select all the notes
            that you want to begin on, say, quarter note boundaries, and
            then use this dialog to make FreeStyle re-transcribe the
            music accordingly. Or, select a few notes right where a
            Sense Tempo recording's notation seems to have gone awry,
            and use this dialog to tell Sense Tempo what the separation
            between those notes should be.<font size="3"><br>

              adjustment features, this option will actually change the
              performance of the original material, since it expands or
              reduces the amount of time between the selected notes and
              other notes before or after the selected range. However,
              for large corrections this is sometimes the only way to
              accomplish the task, since there is a limit to how much a
              tempo map can be changed. Also, this option is very useful
              for placing the first note when you begin to beat-correct

              map in the beat area immediately preceding the selected
              note. This option should always be used whenever notes
              precede the selected notes, in order to preserve the

                The 'Initial note separation becomes' setting</font></b><br>
            <font size="2">The initial note separation is the musical
              distance between the first two selected notes. For
              example, if you select an entire performance which is
              mostly quarter notes, but the first two selected notes
              should be separated only by an 8th note, then set Initial
              note separation becomes to an 8th note.<font size="3"><br>
              </font></font><font size="2">If the first few notes are
              all in a chord, then you should set the Initial note
              separation to be the separation between that chord and the
              next note or chord.<font size="3"><br>
              </font></font><font size="2">If you have selected 'Use
              Sense Tempo Swing' from the Identify Beats Mode popup,
              then be careful how you set the initial note separation.
              Most of the time, you will want to set it to either a
              triplet 8th or triplet quarter note, depending on the
              rhythmic separation of the first two notes you will play.

              positioned according to the settings on the left side of

              set to measure boundaries, beat boundaries (as determined
              by the meter changes in the music) or a fixed grid with a
              note duration that you specify. For example, if you are in
              4/4 and the notation shows three quarter note triplets
              that you know should be quarter notes, select the three
              notes, set Grid is to beats, and click Do It to make

              the tempos should be. With these two options, the notes
              that you selected need not be all on the beat. But you
              should be careful not to select slow grace notes or notes
              that were played badly out of time with the rest of the
              performance. When you use either of these options, the way
              Sense Tempo processes the notes is controlled by the
              current settings in the Sense Tempo Settings dialog box.
              For the Use Sense Tempo Swing option, the duration you

              </font><font size="2">FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature
                allows you to record your music without listening to a
                metronome click while FreeStyle detects the tempo you
                are playing and properly aligns its own beats and
                barlines with your performance. The result is a
                precisely captured performance of your music that lines
                up with FreeStyle's beats and barlines -- which also
                results in a readable transcription in the Notation
                view.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">How does FreeStyle do it?
                It splits what you play into a stream of recorded notes
                and a tempo map that matches the tempo changes in your
                performance. The tempo map is recorded with a high
                degree of precision, ensuring that what gets recorded
                sounds exactly like what you played.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">And because your
                performance is aligned with FreeStyle's beats and
                barlines, you enjoy all of the benefits of using the
                Notation View and all of FreeStyle's other features,
                such as Quantizing, that depend on a note's position
                within the measure.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">With Sense Tempo, you can
                play at a constant tempo, or you can play rubato,
                changing tempo as freely as you like as you play. The
                Sense Tempo Settings dialog lets you give FreeStyle an
                idea of how much or how little you'll change tempos as
                you play so that it can produce results that are as
                accurate as possible.<font size="3"><br>

                metronome either on or off. If you begin with it turned
                on, FreeStyle will use the audible click as an
                indication of the tempo you will begin playing at. Once
                you begin Sense Tempo recording, however, the metronome
                will turn itself off so you can play as freely as you
                wish. <font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">If you record with the
                metronome turned off, you must tell FreeStyle what the
                separation is between the first two notes or chords you
                play so it can figure out your initial tempo.The next

              the denominator of the predominant meter. When you are

              triplet 8ths. (More on this later in the topic called <u>Sense

            you're not playing swing and you know that most of your
            notes are going to be half notes, you may get better results
            if you set this to half notes even though the meter you are
            playing in is 4/4. Or, if you're playing in 6/8 but you're
            playing mostly dotted quarter notes, set it to dotted
            quarter notes. If you are in 4/4 but playing mostly 8th
            notes, set it to 8th notes.<font size="3"><br>

                must tell it where your first note should go, and what
                the separation between the first two notes or chords
                should be. These two pieces of information together give
                Sense Tempo enough to go on without a metronome as an

                If you would like to use Sense Tempo Swing together with
                initial note separation as a means of getting started,
                most of the time you'll want to choose either a triplet
                8th note or triplet quarter note as the initial note
                separation, depending on the rhythmic separation of the
                first two notes you will play. Why? This gets a little
                tricky, but here's a basic explanation. If the
                separation between the first two events would be written
                in straight time as a dotted eighth to a sixteenth, tell
                Sense Tempo that the initial note separation is a
                triplet quarter (which equals two triplet eighths), as
                shown below. If the separation between the first two
                events would be written in straight time as a sixteenth
                leading into a dotted eighth note (or quarter) as shown
                below, tell Sense Tempo that the initial note separation
                is a triplet 8th.<font size="3"><br>

              Q: I recorded a Take without listening to the metronome,
              and without Sense Tempo turned on. Is there a way I can
              process the notes with Sense Tempo after the fact?</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A: Yes, by using the Identify Beats dialog.
            Identify Beats is really just a manual interface for
            controlling FreeStyle's tempo sensing algorithm. If you want
            to process the notes just as if Sense Tempo had been turned
            on at the time they were recorded, do the following:<br>
          </font>1. Select all the notes in the Take.<br>
          2. Choose 'Identify Beats' from the Region menu.<br>
          3. Specify where the first note or chord should be positioned,
          using the measure, beat and tick fields below 'First selected
          note becomes:'.<br>
          4. Choose 'Stretch beat to first note' (unless you are at the
          beginning of the piece and want to move the first note or
          chord by more than a beat).<br>
          5. Set 'Initial note separation becomes:' to the separation
          you wish to have between the first two selected notes or
          chords.<br>
          6. Set the mode popup menu in the upper right of the Identify
          Beats dialog to 'Sense Tempo' (if the material was played in
          straight rhythm) or 'Sense Tempo Swing' (if the material was
          played with a swing rhythm).<br>
          7. Un-check 'Adjust beats after selected region'.8. Click on
          the 'Do It' button.<br>
          When you click 'Do It,' FreeStyle will process all of the
          selected notes and create a tempo map which will adjust the
          placement of beats in the Take. If you do not like the
          results, choose 'Undo' from the Edit menu and see the 'Sense
          Tempo Settings' topic about how to use the 'Sense Tempo
          Settings' dialog. Usually, however, it's faster to just use
          Identify Beats again to fix whatever errors were made as
          described below.<font size="3"><br>
          </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
              Q: I recorded a Take with Sense Tempo and the results were
              great for a while. But after a point the notation and
              tempo got all out of whack. How do I fix that?</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A: Sometimes FreeStyle's tempo sensing
            algorithm just makes a bad decision. This will happen more
            frequently when playing with swing, when playing grace
            notes, when playing sloppy triplets, or when changing tempos
            abruptly. Luckily, it's very easy to tell FreeStyle where it
            went wrong. Simply find the first point in the music where
            the separation between two notes or chords is not what it
            should be. You will be able to hear where the mistake is
            pretty easily if you turn the metronome on. Play the music
            back and listen for the point at which the metronome is
            completely not what you would expect. Then look at the
            notation for the music at that point. You will find that the
            separation between two notes somewhere is just wrong. For
            example, in 4/4 time FreeStyle may have decided that you
            sped up and played 3 quarter notes when in fact you intended
            to maintain a slower tempo and play triplet quarter notes.
            Once you have identified the earliest point at which the
            notation goes awry, do the following:<br>
          </font>1. Select the last note which is notated properly and
          the first note which is notated improperly (i.e., the first
          two notes that have an improper separation).<br>
          2. Choose 'Identify Beats' from the Region menu.<br>
          3. Specify where the first note or chord should be positioned,
          using the measure, beat and tick fields below 'First selected
          note becomes:'.<br>
          4. Choose 'Stretch beat to first note'.<br>
          5. Set 'Initial note separation becomes:' to the separation
          you wish to have between the selected notes or chords.<br>
          6. Set the mode popup menu in the upper right of the Identify
          Beats dialog to 'Sense Tempo' (if the following material was
          played in straight rhythm) or 'Sense Tempo Swing' (if the
          following material was played with a swing rhythm).<br>
          7. Make sure there is a check mark in front of 'Adjust beats
          after selected region'.<br>
          8. Select 'sense tempo through end of section'.<br>
          9. Click on the 'Do It' button.<br>
          FreeStyle will then correct its error and redo the Sense Tempo
          processing from that point through the end of the section. You
          can give it an even better chance of getting it right by
          selecting a few of the following notes which should be on the
          beat, or on some grid, and setting the mode popup in the upper
          right of the dialog to 'All selected notes are on grid.'<font
            size="3"><br>
          </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
              Q: In the Identify Beats dialog, when would I want to
              choose 'All selected notes are on grid' instead of 'Use
              Sense Tempo' or 'Use Sense Tempo Swing?'</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A: Use 'All selected notes are on the grid'
            when you want to make sure that particular notes are aligned
            exactly on certain beats or grid points. This is especially
            useful for forcing groups of notes to be triplets. When you
            select some notes and do an Identify Beats operation with
            'Use Sense Tempo' or 'Use Sense Tempo Swing,' you are
            letting FreeStyle decide which notes to use as anchor points
            for beat adjustments. In that case it won't make a beat
            adjustment for every single note you select Ń it will skip
            over some notes and use other notes as the basis for when a
            tempo change should start. In the triplet example just
            mentioned, this might result in FreeStyle deciding against
            recognizing the triplet.<br>
          </font>Sometimes you can get better results by making those
          decisions yourself. To take command of the situation, select
          the notes that you feel are the best determiners of where the
          beats lie and choose 'All selected notes are on grid.' This
          setting really means 'All selected notes are on grid, except
          maybe for the first two.' The placement of the first two notes
          or chords is determined by your settings in the left hand side
          of the dialog, but all the rest of the selected notes will be
          forced to a position on the specified grid. When you use this
          technique, FreeStyle will know exactly how to adjust the beats
          in the area around the selected notes.<font size="3"><br>
          </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
              Q: How can I adjust the beats in a measure or two without
              affecting the notation and tempos in later measures?</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A: Often you will finish beat adjusting an
            entire section and then find a measure in the middle
            somewhere that you would like to fine-tune. In this case,
            you want to adjust beats in an isolated area, but not
            disturb any of the later beat adjustments that are correct
            through the end of the section. The easiest way to
            accomplish this is to view the music in the graphic editor,
            and then select 'Adjust Beats' from the Song menu. Make sure
            you un-check the option labelled 'Adjust all following
            beats, too.' Then follow the instructions for dragging beat
            lines in the "Adjust Beats" on-line help topic and you will
            be able to adjust beat positions without disturbing later
            notation.<br>
          </font>You can also make this kind of adjustment in either the
          Notation view or the Graphic editing view by using the
          Identify Beats dialog. In order to accomplish this, you must
          perform a series of Identify Beats operations with the 'Adjust
          all following beats, too' option turned off. First, identify
          the first note in the bar that follows the bar you want to
          change. Double-click on it to see the note detail dialog, and
          make a note of its exact start time. We'll call this note the
          'anchor' note. Then go back to the previous bar, select just
          the first two notes whose separation is incorrect and use
          Identify Beats to force the separation to be correct. Continue
          to choose pairs of notes to correct separations in the
          incorrect bar until the end of the bar is reached. Then make
          one final selection of notes, using your 'anchor' note as the
          second note in the selection. Carefully set the separation so
          that the anchor note gets positioned exactly as before. If you
          did each of the 'Identify Beats' operations with the 'Adjust
          all following beats, too' option turned off, FreeStyle will
          not have touched the tempo map beyond the last note selected.
          So once you get the anchor note back to the position it used

              Q: Can I record multiple Takes with 'Sense Tempo?'</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A: Yes! Simply choose 'New Take' from the
            Record menu, turn on Sense Tempo and record. FreeStyle
            remembers which tempo map is associated with each Sense
            Tempo Take. Whenever you choose a Take that was recorded
            with Sense Tempo, that Take's tempo map will become the
            current tempo map and all other players will follow the same
            tempo changes during playback.<font size="3"><br>

              Q: Can I 'conduct' a sequence by recording a Sense Tempo
              overdub?</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A: Yes! This is a neat trick made possible by
            the fact that FreeStyle remembers which tempo map was in
            effect at the time that each Take was recorded. When you use
            Sense Tempo, Identify Beats or Adjust Beats, FreeStyle
            modifies the notation only for those Takes which were
            recorded while the current tempo map was in effect.<br>
          </font>To 'conduct' a sequence by recording a Sense Tempo
          overdub, do the following:<br>
          1. First make sure that all of the existing Takes are
          beat-aligned to your satisfaction.<br>
          2. This is probably the case if they were all recorded while
          listening to a metronome.<br>
          3. Record-enable a player and choose 'New Take' from the
          Record menu.<br>
          4. Click on the solo button for the record-enabled
          player.Since tempo adjustment does not happen completely in
          real time, it would be impossible to play along with the other
          parts while changing tempo.<br>
          5. Choose 'Sense Tempo' or 'Sense Tempo Swing' from the record
          mode popup menu in the control palette.<br>
          6. Click the Play button or press the space bar to begin
          recording.<br>
          7. Click the Stop button or press the space bar again to stop
          when you are done recording.<br>
          8. Un-click the solo button for the record-enabled player.<br>
          When you are done recording, FreeStyle will adjust beats only
          for the notes of your newly recorded Take. The old Takes will
          notate exactly as they did before. However, when you play the
          music back, all players will follow the tempo changes
          generated by the Take you just recorded!<br>
          You can also use FreeStyle's numerous tempo control features
          to add tempo changes or a rubato feel to a FreeStyle document,
          too. For example, you can record the tempo slider in the
          Control palette as you listen to your music to add tempo
          nuances. These features are covered in detail in the on-line
          help topic called 'Tempo'.<font size="3"><br>

              Q: No matter what I do, I can't get the notation to change
              for a given Take when I use Identify Beats or Adjust
              Beats. What's wrong?</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A: It's possible that the current tempo map is
            not the tempo map that was in effect when the Take in
            question was recorded. A beat adjustment operation in
            FreeStyle will have no effect on the notation for Takes
            which were recorded while some other tempo map was in
            effect. You can choose which tempo map is active by
            selecting it in the 'Tempo source' menu inside the Ensemble
            palette (you may have to expand the Ensemble palette in
            order to see this menu). If a Take was not recorded using
            Sense Tempo, then it was most likely recorded while 'Section
            Map, Take 1' was the tempo source.<font size="3"><br>

              Q: Can I use Sense Tempo while recording more music onto
              the end of a Take?</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">A: Yes! Simply start recording with Sense Tempo
            at any point after the last note in the take. When you are
            finished, FreeStyle will adjust the beats only for the new
            notes that you recorded, leaving the beginning of the Take
            untouched.<font size="3"><br>

              The problem</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">Some MIDI instruments (certain variations of
            Proteus series from E-mu Systems, Alesis keyboards, and
            others) do not handle pan messages in a standard fashion
            when dealing with stereo sounds that are made of two
            samples, (one panned left and the other right). But if you
            send a MIDI pan message to one of these devices, it responds
            by panning both samples in the stereo pair to the value of
            the MIDI pan event. So if you send a pan message with a
            value of 64 (center), both samples get panned to the center,
            resulting in a mono sound. Once this situation occurs, there
            is usually no way to correct the pan settings via further
            MIDI messages. Usually the only way to restore the stereo
            panning is to do so via the front panel controls on the
            device itself.<br>
          </font>This can be a problem because FreeStyle sends pan
          messages all the time. When you choose a sound for a player,
          FreeStyle sends pan data to the player. When you press play,
          FreeStyle sends pan data to each player to ensure that they
          begin with the correct pan setting in the Ensemble palette.
          The result is that if you have a MIDI instrument that handles
          stereo sounds in the manner described above, you'll never
          actually hear them in stereo when using FreeStyle.<font
            size="3"><br>
          </font><b><font color="#0000a0"><br>
              The solution</font></b><br>
          <font size="2">You can prevent FreeStyle from automatically
            sending pan data to a MIDI device by doing the following
            things:<br>
          </font>1. Choose Studio Setup from the Setup menu, expand the
          details for the device in question, and check the 'Pan
          disrupts stereo' device property as shown below.<br>
          <img data="bm75.jpg" title="bm75.jpg"><br>
          2. Back in FreeStyle, lock the MIDI channel of any player that
          uses a stereo sound from that MIDI instrument. Choose a MIDI
          channel as high as possible to avoid channels that may have
          already received a pan message.<br>
          3. For information about locking players, see <u>Locking
            Player MIDI Channels</u>. Don't change the pan setting for
          the player in the Ensemble palette, and don't draw any pan
          events for the player in the Controller view.<br>
          Remember, as soon as a MIDI pan message is sent to the
          instrument, the problem will occur. Steps 1 and 2 above will
          prevent FreeStyle from sending pan events automatically to the
          device, but you must also not send any manually by any of the
          methods already discussed.<font size="3"><br>

          the drum machine. In either case, the two will remain tightly
          in sync. They will start, stop, rewind, and locate together,
          and their playback won't drift over time.FreeStyle supports
          several industry standard synchronization formats, including

                  standard 24 clocks per quarter note. This new method

                  the quarter note as the beat unit: 3/8, 5/16, etc. In
                  6/8, for example, there might be a metronome click
                  every three eighth notes; in 4/1, the metronome would
                  click once every whole note. If you were using a less

                  command to be the first clock signal. The first clock
                  signal they send would be 1/24th of a beat after the

                experiment: set the metronome to the slowest possible
                tempo, play both devices (with FreeStyle as slave) and
                listen for discrepancies in attacks and beat alignment.
                The difference of 1/24th of a beat is very audible at a
                slow tempo. If FreeStyle seems slightly behind the
                master device, try checking this option.<font size="3"><br>

                  </font><font size="2">MIDI Beat Clocks consist of a
                    continuous stream of real-time messages. They are
                    produced by most MIDI compatible drum machines and
                    sequencers, and by some synthesizers (particularly
                    those with built-in sequencers). MIDI beat clocks
                    are transmitted 24 times per beat. If the master
                    device changes tempo, the MIDI beat clocks slow down
                    or speed up accordingly; any slave device will
                    follow this tempo change.<font size="3"><br>

                  MIDI data you like into FreeStyle, including System
                  Exclusive data and NRPNs.<br>
                </font>Below is an example of the many types of data you
                can insert.<br>
                Controllers, such as Main Volume and Channel Pressure,
                have a value range from zero (0) to 127. To change their
                value, just double-click it in the ST column.<br>
                Pitch Bend events have a value range from -8192 to 8191.
                Most of the time, you'll probably find it easier and
                more intuitive to edit them in the Controller pane in
                the Graphic Editing window, which provides pencil, line
                and curve tools.<br>
                Switch controllers, like sustain pedal, let you type in
                the word 'On' or 'Off'. You can also enter a number
                between 0 and 127, where values between 0-63 are Off and
                64-127 are On.<br>
                To edit the data within a system exclusive, RPN, or NRPN
                event, double-click it. You will then see the editor
                windows as shown below. For details, see <u>RPNs and

                and NRPN (Non Registered Parameter Number) messages
                provide a way to extend the MIDI specification by
                introducing new MIDI messages that were not envisioned
                at the time the specification was written. These
                messages may or may not be supported by a given
                synthesizer; only a few are detailed in the current
                official MIDI specification, and many are limited to
                specific brands (or even models) of synthesizer. Check
                your synthesizer's manual to see which RPN and NRPN
                messages are supported.<br>
              </font>In essence, RPN and NRPN messages are simply MIDI
              controller messages that contain both information about
              what should be changed, and how it should be changed. For
              instance, when a conforming synthesizer receives RPN
              message 0 with a value of 110, it changes its pitch bend
              sensitivity (specified by the message number of 0) to the
              value specified in the message (110).<br>
              The MIDI 1.0 Specification lists three RPN (Registered
              Parameter Number) messages; these message types have been
              registered with the MIDI Manufacturers Association, and
              many synthesizer manufacturers agree to implement their
              synthesizers' responses to these messages.<br>

                their instruments to respond to various messages not

                to each synthesizer manufacturer, and may only be
                implemented for a particular model of synthesizer.<br>

                  Basics</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">System Exclusive messages are a
              special type of MIDI data. A System Exclusive message
              consists of a header, body, and an 'end of message' byte.
              (A byte is a unit of digital information, roughly
              equivalent to a single character or letter.)<br>
            </font>The header labels the following data as System
            Exclusive information, and includes a code identifying the
            manufacturer of the equipment transmitting the data.<br>
            The body of the message contains the actual data being sent.
            This data may take any form the manufacturer desires. While
            there are some standards for the format of System Exclusive
            information, for the most part a System Exclusive message is
            only understood by the type of equipment that generated it.
            As a result, recording a patch dump from one synthesizer and
            sending it to another will generally not produce useful
            results. FreeStyle does not respond to or interpret System
            Exclusive data; any analysis or editing of the body of the
            message is your responsibility.<br>
            Finally, the end of message byte, F7, marks the end of the
            System Exclusive data, and signals FreeStyle to interpret
            subsequent information as standard MIDI data.<br>
            As defined in the MIDI specification, a System Exclusive
            message must begin and end with an F0 and F7 byte,
            respectively. In addition, only hexadecimal values of 7F
            (127 in base ten) or less are allowed. When you click the OK
            button after inserting or editing the contents of a System
            Exclusive event, FreeStyle will highlight any bytes that
            violate the conditions just stated, and it will alert you
            about what's wrong.<font size="3"><br>

                Recording and Playing System Exclusive Messages</font></span></b><font
            size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">System Exclusive messages are recorded
            and played back like any other MIDI data. These messages
            vary in size; information for a bank of patches, for
            instance, may be 100K or more. No matter how long a message
            is, it is treated as a single event by FreeStyle. Note that
            a long System Exclusive message can briefly halt recording
            or playback as FreeStyle processes the data; it is best to
            place larger System Exclusive events like patch or bank
            dumps in separate sections, or at the start of a section in
            measure zero (the pickup bar) before the actual music
            begins.<br>
          </font>Because System Exclusive messages have no channel
          assignment, they are sent to every MIDI device connected to
          the computer's serial port (either directly or via a MIDI
          interface). If you have several devices of the same model or
          brand connected to the same port, they may all respond to a
          message sent to or from just one of them. Conversely, some
          manufacturers encode channel assignments into the body of the
          System Exclusive message. FreeStyle is unable to access or
          rechannelize such an assignment.<br>
          For example, if the playback assignment for a player is
          channel 1, but a System Exclusive message full of patches
          intended for that synth includes an encoded assignment to
          channel 16, the synth won't receive the patches.<br>
          Find out if any of your equipment encodes channel assignments
          in its System Exclusive messages, and be careful about
          changing channel assignments on equipment to which you intend
          to send System Exclusive. If you encounter difficulty when
          working with System Exclusive data, try connecting the MIDI
          device directly to your MIDI interface, to prevent interaction
          with other equipment.<font size="3"><br>

            or in the Event List window (with All Events or System
            Exclusive chosen in the Show menu). In the Event List, a
            System Exclusive message will consist of the label Sysex and

          </font><img data="bm177.jpg" title="bm177.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">The window is divided into a top and
            bottom portion. The bottom portion displays the system
            exclusive data contained in the event. The top portion is
            used to type in and transmit short system exclusive
            "request" messages, which can be sent to a synthesizer that
            requires a short system exclusive bulk dump request message
            to initiate a bulk dump to be recorded into the lower
            portion of the window.<br>
          </font>The System Exclusive data is displayed in hexadecimal
          (base 16) numbering. Each pair of hexadecimal digits, which
          include the numerals 0-9 and the letters A-F, represents a
          byte of data. Each line contains eight pairs of digits. To the
          left of each line of data is a two-digit hexadecimal number
          indicating the position of the first byte of data in that row.
          The first row starts at position 00, the next at 08, the third
          at 10 (this is 16 in hexadecimal), and so forth.<br>
          The length of the System Exclusive message is displayed at the
          lower left. This is the number of bytes of data in the
          message.<br>
          The scroll bars let you scroll through long messages. When you
          press the OK button, FreeStyle checks the changes you have
          made to the data and will scroll to and highlight any byte
          that does not conform to the MIDI specification. After

              </font><font size="2">Most synthesizers and many other
                MIDI devices allow you to dump patch settings as System
                Exclusive messages. You can use FreeStyle to store and
                organize these messages, creating a library of patches
                and presets. Store each patch or bank of patches as a
                separate section in one or more files. This way you can
                use the section name to label your presets. To restore a
                patch or bank, view the desired section and play it.
                However, if you would like a much more intuitive and
                powerful means to do this, check out Mark of the
                Unicorn's Unisyn software, a universal editor librarian
                package that supports hundreds of current and vintage
                MIDI gear.<br>
              </font>You can paste System Exclusive dumps of sounds and
              settings at the start of a section. This lets you use
              patches or settings that can't fit into your MIDI devices'
              preset storage, and ensures that the right sounds are
              loaded for the song. Use the standard Copy and Paste
              commands to place the system exclusive events at the start
              of the sequence. It is best to leave a measure or two of
              space after the system exclusive messages and the start of
              the music, to allow your equipment to process the data.<br>
              Some manufacturers allow you to edit patch parameters over
              MIDI, using short system exclusive messages. This can add
              a great deal of expression to a sequence. For example, the
              attack of a filter envelope could be controlled with
              system exclusive and controller data, creating different
              bowing effects for a violin patch.<font size="3"><br>

              </font><font size="2">System exclusive data is not
                associated with a channel, as defined in the MIDI
                specification. System exclusive data is merely sent to
                the serial port you have specified for playback; no
                channel number can be attached. Some manufacturers have
                decided to include a channel number in some of their
                system exclusive messages. This number cannot be
                changed. Therefore, even if data is being sent to
                channel 3, for example, system exclusive messages
                contained in that data might be sent to a channel other
                than 3.<br>
              </font>System exclusive data is complex, and varies
              greatly from device to device. If you are uncertain about
              your equipment's system exclusive implementation, you
              should be very careful in using or editing system
              exclusive data. Most of the time, turning a piece of
              equipment off and then on again will clear any strange
              behavior caused by incorrect system exclusive data;
              however, incorrect use of system exclusive data could
              permanently erase presets from a synthesizer or other MIDI
              device.<font size="3"><br>

          </font><font size="2">The topics that follow tell you how to
            control FreeStyle's recording features with the mouse. You
            can also use the computer keyboard, and even the keys on
            your MIDI controller, for all of the essential steps in the
            recording process, from choosing a section to controlling
            FreeStyle's transport controls. <br>
          </font>The tutorial makes more sense if you view your music in
          the graphic editing view instead of the notation view. If you
          want to leave this help window open while you do the tutorial,
          remember to click back on the editing window before attempting
          to use menu commands. Many menu commands are greyed out when
          this help window is frontmost.<br>
          To begin, go to the File menu and choose New to open a new
          blank document. FreeStyle will ask you to choose an Ensemble.
          Choose Rock Band and click OK.<font size="3"><br>

            Record Loop</font></span><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">The Record Loop consists of a small pair
          of draggable repeat sign markers in the time line as shown
          below. These markers cause playback to endlessly repeat a
          range of measures within a section. The area being cycled can
          be as short as one bar or as long as the entire section. When
          the record loop markers are visible, the record loop is on. To
          toggle it on and off, use the Toggle Record Loop command in
          the Record menu. For this tutorial, toggle them off because we
          will be using the Auto Loop Record feature.<font size="3"><br>

          set them up before you begin recording. In each case shown
          below, check the menu item to turn on the feature. Uncheck it
          to turn it off. For this tutorial, check Wait For Note, Auto

          repeatedly cycle in the pickup bar until you play your first
          note. If you plan to play pickup notes or anywhere near the
          downbeat of measure one, Wait for note works well. If you plan
          not to play until a few beats past the measure 1 downbeat,
          turn it off.<font size="3"><br>

              duplicate them just before the end of the record loop so
              that you don't hear a gap in the music when it repeats.
              Notes that are duplicated automatically when this option
              is turned on are indicated by a cross within the note as

              in the Arrangement window. But since we haven't done this
              in this tutorial, it is currently grayed out in the menu

                Set the tempo and metronome</font></span><font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">Recording with the metronome helps
              ensure that FreeStyle's measures and beats properly match
              what you play -- although you don't have to listen to the
              metronome to accomplish this. FreeStyle's Sense Tempo
              feature allows you to record without the metronome while
              FreeStyle follows the tempo you play. However, recording
              with the metronome sometimes produces better
              transcription.<br>
            </font>So before recording with the metronome, drag the
            tempo slider in the Control palette to the desired tempo.
            Afterwards, you can raise or lower the tempo without
            affecting the pitch of the music. This is a great technique
            for playing in music accurately: record it slow and then
            play it back at normal speed. To set up a metronome, choose
            <u>Metronome</u> from the Setup menu.<font size="3"><br>

            rewind, record and play buttons in the Control Palette. If
            Wait For Note is checked, FreeStyle will endlessly cycle the
            first bar until you play your first note. If you don't want
            it to do so, uncheck the Wait For Note command in the Record
            menu.<br>

        </font><font size="2">The Keep Recording command in the Record
          menu is a way of protecting what you have recorded so far so
          the "Undo Recording" command in the Edit menu won't erase it.<br>
        </font>This command is especially useful when recording drum
        parts. Most of the time, you'll record each drum (e.g. kick,
        snare, hi hat) into a single take for a single player named
        Drums (or a similar name). But what should you do if you've
        recorded the kick and snare, and you like what you've got so
        far, but then you make a mistake when adding the hi hat? If you
        choose Undo Recording, you'll lose the kick and snare also. If
        you choose New Take, the kick and snare will disappear.<br>
        This is where the Keep Recording command helps: it causes
        everything you've recorded into the take so far to be "kept"
        when you use Undo. So in our current example, if you recorded
        kick and snare, and you like what you have so far, you choose
        Keep Recording (from the Record menu) before you add anything
        else. Then, if you make a mistake when adding the hi hat, you
        can use Undo Recording to discard the hi hat without losing the
        kick and snare. <font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note:















































































          Keep Recording is not a substitute for saving your file! Keep
          Recording will protect your notes from Undo Recording, but new
          notes are never actually saved to the file until you use Save
          or Save As in the File menu.<font size="3"><br>

              </font><font size="2">After you have recorded several
                sections, you are ready to make a song. Choose "New
                Song" from the song menu and enter the name "My Song."
                The FreeStyle Arrangement window will appear. On the
                left is a list of all of your sections -- if you have
                been following this tutorial, you'll only have two of
                them. Type the letters "a-b-a-b" in succession to
                quickly place your first two sections onto the
                arrangement grid. Or, if you prefer you can drag each
                section from the list on the left to a position on the
                grid to the right. For now make sure you put sections in
                the top row of the grid, which is the "primary song
                structure row."<font size="3"><br>

              </font></font><font size="2">First make sure that the
              graphic editing/notation window is displaying the song "My
              Song." To do this, click on the "View:" popup menu in the
              upper left corner of the window and choose "My Song."
              Section names are listed first in this popup, followed by
              a divider line, then all of the song names.<br>
            </font><img data="bm54.jpg" title="bm54.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">Another way to show your song in the
              graphic editing/notation window is to click on the
              arrangement window, or choose "Arrangement Window" from
              the Windows menu.<br>

              Single-section recording within a song</font></span><font
            size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">In the arrangement window, click on one
            of the "Verse" sections that you placed on the arrangement
            grid. A red bar will appear across the top of the section to
            indicate that the section is record-enabled. Recording can
            now happen only within the bounds of the "Verse" -- notes
            that you play while the wiper is over any other section will
            not be recorded. However, each section in FreeStyle has a
            pickup bar and an overhang bar that overlap neighboring
            sections in the arrangement. Therefore, notes can actually
            be recorded 1 bar before what you think of as the start of
            the "Verse", and up to 1 bar following what you think of as
            the end of the "Verse." Notes recorded in the pickup or
            overhang measures of a section nonetheless are part of that
            section, not part of neighboring sections in the
            arrangement. To see this in action, let's record something
            new. Choose "New Take" from the Record menu. Look in the
            Record menu and make sure that "Follow Song" is not checked.
            Next, make sure that the record button is on in the control
            palette, then click on the rewind and play buttons. Start
            playing something a beat or so before the wiper gets to bar
            1, and continue playing past the end of the first "Verse."
            You will notice that notes appear in the graphic editing
            view as you play until one bar past the end of the
            record-enabled section. Then the rest of your notes are
            ignored until the time wiper reaches the next instance of
            "Verse" in your arrangement.<br>
          </font><img data="bm154.jpg" title="bm154.jpg"><br>
          Now choose "Verse" from the "View:" popup menu in the upper
          left corner of the graphic editing view. You will clearly see
          that some of your notes fell in the pickup and overhang bars
          of the Verse section, but they are nonetheless part of the
          Verse.<br>
          <img data="bm155.jpg" title="bm155.jpg"><br>
          If you want to make a linear recording that plays back at the
          same time as your "Verse" and "Chorus" sections, you can do
          the following. First, type Alt-W-2 to bring the Arrangement
          window to the front again. Choose "New Section" from the Song
          menu. Name the section "Linear." The name "Linear" appears at
          the bottom of the sections list on the left side of the
          arrangement window. Drag the "Linear" section out onto the
          second row of the arrangement window starting at bar 1.<font
            size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2"><img data="bm156.jpg" title="bm156.jpg"></font><font
            size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">The "Linear" section now has a red bar
            over it, indicating that it has become the record-enabled
            section. Click the rewind and play buttons, and begin
            recording notes into this section. When you reach the end of
            the section, it will simply grow to the right as you keep
            playing. The graphic editing window will show the new notes
            that you have recorded, overlapping notes that are
            simultaneously playing in the Verse and Chorus sections. The
            linear section can grow to accommodate the notes you play
            because there are no other sections in the way to the right
            of it on row 2. In the previous example when we were
            recording into the "Verse" section it didn't grow because
            the "Chorus" section was immediately following it in row 1.<br>

            </font><font size="2">Suppose you have a bunch of sections
              lined up end to end in the top row of the arrangement
              grid, and you want to record Clarinet takes for each
              section while you play the entire song. To do this, select
              "Follow Song" in the Record menu. When this feature is
              turned on, the record-enabled section will move to the
              next section in the top row of the arrangement grid as
              each section is encountered, as you play. Note, however,
              that in this case you are not recording a single take like
              you did when you recorded into the separate "Linear"
              section. In this case your notes go into the current take
              selected in each section, in turn, as it is encountered.<br>
            </font>Type Alt-W-2 to bring the Arrangement window to the
            front again. The View popup menu in the graphic
            editing/notation window shows "My Song." Make sure that
            "Follow Song" is checked in the Record menu and that the
            record button is on in the control palette. Just to give us
            something new to record, let's add a player to the ensemble.
            Choose "Add Player" from the Setup menu and choose
            "Clarinet" from the Player Library Entry drop-down list,
            then click OK. You will see that a Clarinet player has been
            added in the ensemble palette, and that the Clarinet player
            is record-enabled. Now click the rewind and play buttons and
            play Clarinet notes while the first two "Verse" and "Chorus"
            sections play. This time, when the wiper is over the body of
            the first Verse section, the notes will go into the Verse
            and when the wiper is over the body of the first Chorus
            section, the notes will go into the Chorus. You may notice
            that as the wiper reaches the end of the Verse section and
            enters the Chorus section, the red bar in the arrangement
            window moves from the Verse to the Chorus, indicating that
            the record-enabled section has automatically changed for
            you. When the wiper reaches the beginning of the second
            Verse section, you will hear the Clarinet notes that you
            recorded in your pass over the first Verse section. Any new
            Clarinet notes that you play will be overdubbed on top of
            the existing notes in the Verse. This is because the section
            "Verse" plays back in exactly the same way wherever it
            appears in your arrangement. <br>
            If you want to make a Verse2 section that can be modified
            independently from the Verse section, do the following:
            Click on the second Verse section in the arrangement grid to
            select it and hit the delete key. Next, click once on the
            name "Verse" in the section list on the left side of the
            arrangement window (not on the first Verse section instance
            that is placed on the arrangement grid). Choose "Duplicate
            Section" from the Song menu. A section called "Verse Copy"
            appears at the bottom of the section list. Double-click on
            "Verse Copy" and type "Verse2" to rename it -- then hit the
            enter key. Drag out "Verse2" and position it in the hole on
            row 1 where the second instance of "Verse" used to be. Now
            you can make changes to Verse2 in your arrangement which
            will not affect the "Verse" section.<br>
            Once you have created a song you are not limited to
            recording into the song as a whole. You can double click on
            any section instance in the arrangement grid to view that
            section in isolation. Then you can record into the section
            as described earlier in this tutorial and your changes will
            affect all songs that use the section.<br>

        Next, you need to choose a player to record into as usual by
        clicking its record button in the Ensemble palette. In this

        keyboard, so be sure to click the Record button in the Control

        the Show menu, so you can see anything you enter.<br>
        Finally, be sure to position the playback wiper at the location
        where you would like to begin inserting notes. For this

          </font><font size="2">Now you are ready to enter some notes.
            Let's start by entering a quarter note G3 (the G above
            middle C) from the computer keyboard. Make sure that the
            Lock to Wiper option is checked (so that the playback wiper
            clearly shows us the Insert Time), and also make sure that
            the main counter (and wiper) are at 1|1|0.<font size="3"><br>

            a Step Size.</font><font size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">The Step Size determines the amount of
            time between consecutive notes or chords that you enter.
            Step Size also determines the duration of the notes, but it
            is important for you to realize that the duration doesn't
            necessarily have to match the step size. For example, you
            might want to enter staccato quarter notes, where the step
            size is 960 ticks but their duration is 25% of the step size
            (240 ticks). For now, in this tutorial, we'll enter quarter
            notes by choosing a step size of one quarter note. In this
            case, let's make the duration 100% of the step size in the
            Duration box below the Insert menu. So choose a quarter note
            from the Step Size menu and make sure it says "+ 0 ticks;
            960 ticks per" next to the menu. (FreeStyle also gives you
            the ability to choose the step size and insert the note (or
            step) in one operation by pressing the F keys (F1, F2, F3,
            etc.) across the top of your computer keyboard. Click <u>here</u></font>

            </font><font size="2">FreeStyle lets you step record notes
              or chords in the middle of existing music. One of two
              things can happen when you do this: either the existing
              notes will stay right where they are (and the new notes
              get merged in with them), or all existing notes after the
              notes being inserted will get shifted later in time to
              make space for the new notes.<br>
            </font>If you want to leave the existing notes where they
            are and merge the new notes with them, just place the
            playback wiper (insert time) where you want, and step enter
            your new material using any of the methods already described
            in this tutorial.<br>
            If you want to insert new material and shift everything
            after it later in time to make space for the new material,
            FreeStyle offers a different technique that involves holding
            down the ALT key while inserting the note. As a final
            example in our tutorial, let's practice this new ALT-key
            insertion technique. We'll practice with notes, but keep in
            mind that it also works for inserting other types of MIDI
            data, too.<br>
            To insert notes and simultaneously shift everything after
            them later in time:<font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              In the Event List window, click on the note (or event)
              immediately preceding the point at which you want to
              insert new material.</font><font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">For the purposes of this
              demonstration, let's choose the last note of the first
              chord we entered. If you've entered exactly the same notes
              as shown in this tutorial, it will be either the A2 or the
              E3 in the chord on the downbeat of measure 1 as shown
              below. This step helps determine where the new material
              will be inserted - but not entirely. You'll also need to
              set the step size as explained in the next step.<br>
            </font><img data="bm85.jpg" title="bm85.jpg"><br>
            Choose a half note step size.<br>
            The step size determines two things: 1) the duration of the
            note being inserted, and 2) the location where it will be
            inserted. In our current example, the new note being
            inserted will be a half note inserted on beat 3, which is a
            half-notes' worth of time after our currently selected note
            on the first beat.<font size="3"><br>

            </font><font size="2">The B-flat half note gets inserted on
              beat 3, and the four eighth notes get shifted down by a
              half note, which moves them into measure 2 as shown below.
              You could also insert the half note by holding down the
              ALT key while pressing the Enter key or while clicking on
              the Insert button.<br>

        </font><font size="2">In general, you'll find it a lot easier to
          use this ALT key insertion technique when viewing a section of
          music, rather than a song. As you can imagine, this technique
          can actually change the length of the section of music in
          which you are inserting the new material, since everything
          else is moving later in time to make room for it. If you try
          to use this technique when viewing a song, it can affect how
          much sections overlap while you are inserting the new music.
          As a result, your music may temporarily look a bit unusual
          when viewing the song - until you have a chance to rearrange
          the sections in the song to accommodate their new length. To
          avoid this temporary confusion, just view the section you want
          to insert in by itself.<br>

                  given a chance to map each track in the file to any
                  player template in your Player Library as shown below.
                  Choose a player template for each track from the
                  pop-up menu.<br>
                  FreeStyle maps each track inside the SMF into a
                  Player. Because of this, do not use tracks that
                  contain events for different channels. If you have
                  tracks like this, pull them apart so that each track
                  only has events for a single channel.<br>
                  FreeStyle does not support program changes in the
                  middle of a track. FreeStyle will use the first
                  program change it sees in a track as the player's
                  sound, but will ignore subsequent program changes.<br>
                  Since FreeStyle currently only supports one global
                  tempo, it will use the first tempo event it sees as
                  the global tempo, and ignore subsequent tempo changes.
                  This also applies to time signature changes.<font

              </font><font size="2">FreeStyle lets you import Standard
                MIDI files into Sections in a Document. This is
                especially useful for transferring sequences from other
                sequencers into FreeStyle. Selecting Import into section
                displays a standard open file dialog.<br>
              </font>FreeStyle then lets you match the tracks in the
              Standard MIDI File with the Players in your Document.
              Unlike opening a Standard MIDI File from scratch, when you
              import into an existing document you have the option of
              either assigning a track to an existing player, or of
              creating a player from a player template. The standard
              MIDI file will appear as a new section in the current
              document.<br>
              If you are having trouble importing complex sequences:
              Many sequencers let you work with "sections", "chunks" or
              "sub-sequences". The Standard MIDI File format has no
              provision for storing multiple sections within a single
              file. The answer is to save multiple files, one for each
              section in your sequence. FreeStyle lets you import all of
              these SMFs at once using the "Import into section"
              feature.<br>

          </font><font size="2">When you first create a new FreeStyle
            document or open an existing one from disk, the document is
            stored into the computer's temporary Random Access Memory
            (RAM) as you work. Changes you make to the document occur in
            the temporary version in RAM. The Save command writes the
            current state of your document to disk to store it
            permanently, even after you quit FreeStyle and switch off
            the computer. If you quit FreeStyle without saving, or if
            the computer is suddenly interrupted before you have a
            chance to save the document, all changes you have made to it
            since you last saved are lost forever. It is therefore
            important to save very often to avoid losing your work.<br>
          </font>If you have previously saved a document, the current
          state replaces last saved version. If you are saving a
          document for the first time, a dialog box appears to ask you
          to name it. This dialog box is identical to the Save As dialog
          box explained in the next topic.<br>
          Save frequently--every time you make a change that you like.
          Doing so prevents you from losing work should FreeStyle or the

            Save As</font></span><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">The Save As command is what you use the
          very first time you save a new document. Save As lets you name
          the document and choose where you want to store it on your
          hard disk. Save As also lets you save the currently open
          document on disk under a different name, preserving the
          last-saved version of the original document. Save As is useful
          when you would like to make changes to a document and save
          them, but you still want to preserve the original document. In
          this case, the Save command would not be the right command to
          use because it would replace the original document with the
          newly modified document, thus erasing the original document.
          Instead, Save As creates a new document on disk with the
          changes in it, and the original document remains unmodified
          under its original name.<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font color="#0000a0">Save As file formats</font><br>
        <font size="2">The Save As command lets you save a file in
          several different formats:<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font color="#0000a0">FreeStyle</font><br>
        <font size="2">FreeStyle is the standard FreeStyle file format.
          Use this format to save your FreeStyle files.<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font color="#0000a0">Stationery</font><br>
        <font size="2">When the Stationery option is selected, the file
          is saved as a Stationery file, which acts much like a
          stationery "pad". When you use a stationery pad, you "tear
          off" a blank sheet of paper to work with and leave behind the
          original pad. Stationery documents on the computer work much
          the same way. Stationery files can be opened, but the computer
          will prevent you from modifying the original stationery pad
          file by making you Save As when you attempt to save the file.
          This option is great for preserving files that you do not want
          to modify and that you use regularly as a "template" from
          which to build new files. When saving as Stationery,
          everything in the file gets saved except notes and
          controllers. Saved items include players, sections, and songs.<font
            size="3"><br>

          Stationery</font><br>
        <font size="2">This option is identical to the Stationery option
          (see the previous paragraph) with the following exception.
          Only songs and sections are preserved in the file; players are
          not. When you first open a new file using a Song Structure
          Stationery file, FreeStyle asks you to choose an ensemble.
          This is a convenient way to create song structures that you
          frequently use, such as a pop song structure with Intro,
          Chorus, Verse, Bridge, etc. and choose any type of ensemble
          you want to fill the sections. This feature combines
          convenience with flexibility: you have quick access to a
          customized song structure and you get to choose any ensemble
          to work with.<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font color="#0000a0">Standard MIDI File</font><br>
        <font size="2">This option saves the section or song currently
          displayed in the Graphic Editing window (shown in the View
          pop-up menu) as a standard MIDI file on disk. Music saved in
          this file format can be opened with any music program that
          also reads and writes Standard MIDI Files--even programs that
          run on other types of computers. Each player is saved as a
          track, and only the current take for each player is included;
          other takes are not.<br>
        </font>Be sure to choose the desired section or song in the View
        pop-up menu in the Graphic Editing window as shown below before
        you choose Save As from the File menu. Also be sure that the
        current takes for each player are the ones you want to include.
        Basically, what you hear when you play is what will be included
        in the Standard MIDI File.<br>
        When saving as a Standard MIDI File, only the song or section
        displayed here is included in the file, so be sure to select the
        desired item before saving.<br>

          re-opening the same file. Revert to Saved is useful for

                strip can display any type of controller data for any

                time (i.e. volume for all players at once), although it
                only shows one type of data at a time (i.e. volume or

              that appears in the graphic editing view time line. You
              can place it anywhere you like. When it is visible,
              FreeStyle rewinds to it when you press the rewind button,
              instead of rewinding to the beginning. This is convenient
              if you want to work on a particular section and do not
              want to have to rewind all the way to the beginning each
              time. Use the Show/Hide Rewind Marker command in the View
              menu to turn off (hide) and turn on (show) the rewind
              marker. Use the Place Rewind Marker command to choose
              where you want to put it. You can also just drag it in the
              time line with the mouse.<br>

      <p>Note: If the cursor goes <b>past</b> the Loop points set to
        active, it will automatically snap back into the loop. However,
        if the cursor is before the loop points, it will not. This issue
        (bug?) is also the same with the Rewind marker. Also the rewind
        doesn't go back to the loop's beginning, instead the sections
        start point.</p>

        </font><font size="2">The main purpose of the Tweak Notes
          feature is to scale velocities or durations for selected
          notes. You can move the slider in the dialog during playback
          to make adjustments in real time as you listen to the music.
          You can even set up a record loop over the area you want to
          tweak so it will repeat as you tweak the settings in real
          time. This is a great way to interactively adjust the feel of
          your music. For more information, see <u>Tweak Notes</u></font>.<font

        </font><font size="2">The Tie Notes command in the Region menu -
          and its counterpart in the Step Controls panel - let you
          combine notes of the same pitch. Just select any two notes (or
          more) of the same pitch (by shift-clicking them in the Event
          List, Notation or Graphic Editing window), and choose Tie
          Notes from the Region menu (or click the Tie Notes button in
          the Step Controls panel in the Event List window). This ties
          them together into one note. The Tie Notes command ties the
          notes in the sense of their musical meaning, but they may not
          actually be notated with a tie in FreeStyle's notation
          display. For example, the resulting note may just be a whole
          note.<font size="3"><br>

            FreeStyle's three beat adjustment features. For an overview
            of them, see <u>Beat Adjustment Overview</u></font>. Beat
          Adjustment is when you tell FreeStyle where the beats are in a
          musical performance that for some reason does not match
          FreeStyle's beats and barlines. This situation would arise,
          for example, if you turned off FreeStyle's metronome and then
          recorded a piece of music without FreeStyle's Sense Tempo
          feature. To use Identify Beats, select some notes that you
          would like to use as indicators of where the beats are in the
          music, and then choose Identify Beats from the Region menu.

            lick. The only restriction is that the riff can only use one
            sound. If you have music belonging to more than one player

                Create Play Loop</font></span><font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">A play loop is a region of material
              that repeats itself within the section for as many times
              as you specify. The Create Play Loop command creates a
              play loop out of the currently selected material. If
              nothing is selected, then the measure containing the
              playback wiper becomes the source measure for the loop.
              For your convenience, FreeStyle automatically figures out
              how many repeats are necessary to make the loop play for
              the entire length of the section.<font size="3"><br>
              </font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm48.jpg"
                title="bm48.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">The benefit of creating a play loop
              instead of just copying and pasting by hand is that if you
              make a change to the original material, the change is
              automatically reflected in all iterations of the loop. You
              can even make modifications to iterations within a play
              loop (called overrides) so that the loop doesn't sound
              exactly the same each time it repeats. <br>

          </font><font size="2">This command operates on the measure
            that currently holds the playback wiper. It allows you to
            modify notes in the measure that are part of a playback loop
            without affecting other repititions of the the loop. For
            example, you might want to create a drum fill in one measure
            of a drum loop without causing the fill to be in any other
            measures in the loop.<font size="3"><br>

            durations when quantizing with the Affect Durations check
            box. The Time offset slider lets you shift all notes a
            little bit earlier or later than the grid locations
            themselves, which occur on exact beat divisions, creating
            either a pushed or laid back feel. The Swing slider lets you

          window as shown below. You can also type single-digit numbers
          to select one of the first ten takes for a player, or use the
          up and down arrow keys to cycle through all the takes. The New
          Take command creates a new, empty take for the currently

            </font><font size="2">When Smooth Record Loop is turned on,
              notes that are recorded in the pickup bar are
              automatically played at the end of the record loop. Often
              when you record a loop, you play pickup notes into bar
              one, or you play notes on the down beat of bar one a
              little bit early. In either case, these notes are not
              actually in the loop because they occur before beat 1 of
              the first measure. As a result, they do not play when the
              section loops back to the first measure. Smooth Record
              Loop automatically places pickup bar notes at the end of
              the loop so that they seamlessly lead into the beginning
              of the loop when it repeats. If you hear a "gap" when the
              section repeats, try turning on Smooth Record Loop; most
              likely, the "gap" effect will go away. Smooth Record Loop
              is a checkable menu item. Check it to turn it on; uncheck
              it to turn it off.<font size="3"><br>

            </font><font size="2">FreeStyle lets you record into
              sections and also into songs. The Follow Song command
              affects the process of recording into a song.<font

            <font size="2">When it is turned off (unchecked), FreeStyle
              only records into the currently record-enabled section in
              the Arrangement window (indicated by a red bar as shown
              below). To make a section record-enabled, just click it.<font

            </font><font size="2">As playback proceeds through the song,
              FreeStyle only drops into record when it reaches the
              record-enabled section. If the section appears in the song
              more than once, FreeStyle drops into record each time it
              reaches the record-enabled section. In the example above,
              recording would occur only when the verse plays at
              measures 8-17. (Note that this range includes the measure
              before and the measure after the section. That's because
              each section has a "pickup" and "overhang" measure.)
              FreeStyle drops out of recording during sections that are
              not record-enabled (no red bar).<font size="3"><br>

              Turning On Follow Song</font><br>
            <font size="2">When Follow Song is turned on (checked),
              FreeStyle records into each section in the top row of the
              Arrangement Window as it plays. The top row is called the
              primary song structure row. Notice that the Verse section
              is record-enabled because it is currently playing (the
              scrolling playback wiper is in it). When the wiper reaches
              the next section, Chorus, it will become record-enabled.<font

            </font><font size="2">As you can see, the Follow Song
              feature lets you set up sections in a song before
              recording and then record into them continuously from one
              to the next. FreeStyle automatically places what you play
              in each appropriate section. You can easily go back and
              forth between this style of "linear" recording within a
              song and loop-recording within a single section. The
              Follow Song feature gives you the best of both worlds.<font

            <font size="2">The follow song command can be used any time
              you wish to record without being concerned about what
              section you are in. It is ideal when used with FreeStyle
              Stationery files, which are song templates with sections
              already set up in them, ready for you to record into when
              you start a new document.<br>

              the Duplicate command, copies dragged into the arrangement

              you change the original, all instances of it in the song
              will change, too. If you want to make one instance of a

              Beat Adjustment is when you tell FreeStyle where the beats
              are in a musical performance that for some reason does not
              match FreeStyle's beats and barlines. The Adjust Beats
              palette can be used to correct the beats and barlines for
              a performance that was recorded with the metronome turned
              off. It is also well-suited for adjusting the beats of a
              performance that changes tempo and was recorded without
              Sense Tempo. For complete details, see <u>Adjust Beats</u>.<font

              If you see a generic sound list with names like
              "Patch&nbsp;1" and "Patch&nbsp;2", you have several
              choices.<font size="3"><br>
              </font></font><font size="2">One choice is to just use the
              generic sound names. The patch numbers refer to the MIDI
              program change number for each sound in the MIDI
              instrument. All you have to do is find out what the MIDI
              program change number is for the sound you want to choose.
              For some devices, this is easy because of the way they
              work or because the program change numbers are easy to
              find in the user's manual.<br>
              In the meantime, contact Mark of the Unicorn regarding
              your instrument and we'll gladly add it to our list of
              devices to support in future updates of FreeStyle. For
              information on contacting Mark of the Unicorn by phone,
              fax, or e-mail, see <u>Technical support</u></font>.<br>
            If you consider yourself to be somewhat of a "hacker", you
            can create your own custom sound list. Doing so involves
            editing text files in the freemidi directory that provide
            device information and sound names to FreeStyle.<br>
            To create a custom sound list for your MIDI instrument, open
            and read the following text files (located in the freemidi
            directory located in your Windows directory), which contain
            instructions at the beginning that tell you how to create
            your own device definitions and sound name lists:<font

            Instead, it always uses the channel you've chosen for the
            player. This is ideal for situations where sounds cannot be
            called up on an instrument using MIDI program change events.
            It is also the only way to override FreeStyle's dynamic
            channel allocation, which you may want to avoid for other
            reasons.<br>

          Ensemble palette, a player template in the Player Library, or
          a riff in the Metronome dialog box, set up the sampler so that
          it will play the sound on a specific MIDI channel, and then
          assign the player to that same channel.</font><font size="3"><font

            depends on your MIDI hardware to produce sounds. For
            example, when you record a piano part in FreeStyle, your
            MIDI sound module produces the piano sound that you hear.
            FreeStyle itself produces no sound whatsoever. Instead,
            FreeStyle precisely records performance information: <i>when</i></font>
          notes were played, <i>what</i> notes were played, <i>how
            hard</i> they were struck, <i>how long</i> they were held
          down, and so on. During playback, FreeStyle sends this
          performance information to the MIDI sound module, triggering
          the music that you hear. This is one of the reasons why MIDI
          sequencing is so powerful. It gives you incredible flexibility
          in working with the performances you record and the
          instruments and sounds you choose to play them with.</font><font

            FreeStyle supports General MIDI devices.<br>
            <br>
          </font> </font><font size="3"><font size="2">FreeStyle works
            great with any MIDI compatible synthesizer. But many people
            find General MIDI devices particularly easy to set up and
            use. General MIDI is a term that refers to an
            industry-accepted standard setup for a multi-timbral MIDI
            device. MIDI devices vary widely in their architecture,
            sounds, and capabilities. General MIDI devices adhere to a
            simple set of characteristics that make them similar to all
            other General MIDI devices. For example, every General MIDI
            device provides a standard set of musical instrument sounds,
            including piano, bass, guitar, strings, various drum kits,
            and others. If a MIDI device supports General MIDI, you can
            be sure that it has this standard set of GM sounds. Many GM
            devices provide additional sounds as well. General MIDI
            includes other standard musical characteristics such as
            reverb, chorusing, and so on.</font></font><font size="3"><font

                same time playing a muted trumpet sound on another MIDI
                instrument The result sounds like the two instruments

                  FreeStyle's metronome can play a speaker click on the
                  computer's internal speaker or a click that consists
                  of any sound (such as a side stick or rim shot)
                  produced by a MIDI drum machine or other MIDI
                  instrument. It can also play a custom riff. A riff is
                  a musical phrase played by a single player, usually a
                  drummer. FreeStyle provides a wide selection of stock
                  riffs; most are in the form of two-bar drum loops. You
                  can create your own riffs by using the Save As
                  Metronome command in the Region menu or by placing a
                  standard MIDI file (.MID) in the FreeStyle's metronom
                  directory. (To delete a riff, just remove it from the
                  directory.) Note that a riff doesn't have to be a drum
                  loop; it can be any single instrument that you want,

                  use Remote Controls and at the same time avoid
                  triggering commands unintentionally. Commands only
                  trigger when you hold down the trigger key clump. A
                  key clump is a set of keys that activate the Remote
                  Controls when they are held down together. The Remote
                  Controls are only active while the key clump is being
                  held down. This makes it next to impossible to
                  accidentally enable the Remotes. Best of all, you can
                  choose any combination of keys you want. FreeStyle's
                  factory default key clump is C1 Db1 D1. You can,
                  however, choose any combination of keys you
                  want--anything that you are sure you will never
                  play--by dragging the trigger key onto the desired
                  keyboard keys. If you don't want to use the key clump
                  technique, you can use a MIDI controller instead.<font

                What is synchronization?</font><br>
              <font size="2">FreeStyle's synchronization features allow
                it to play in time with other devices. For example, you
                can make a drum machine play along precisely with
                FreeStyle. Or you can do it the other way around and
                make FreeStyle follow the drum machine. In either case,
                the two will remain tightly in sync. They will start,
                stop, rewind, and locate together, and their playback
                won't drift over time.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">FreeStyle supports several
                industry standard synchronization formats to ensure
                synchronization compatibility in any situation.<font
                  size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font color="#0000a0"><br>
                The Sync command</font><br>
              <font size="2">To get sync going, choose Sync from the
                Setup menu. Use the FreeStyle Receives Sync option when
                you want FreeStyle to follow ('slave to') another
                device. Use the FreeStyle Sends Beat Clocks and
                FreeStyle Sends MTC options when you would like other
                devices to follow time code generated by FreeStyle. Use
                the Destination pop-up menu to tell FreeStyle where to
                send MIDI beat clocks or MIDI Time Code.<font size="3"><br>

                MIDI Time Code</font><br>
              <font size="2">Use this option when you would like
                FreeStyle to follow ('slave to') to MIDI Time Code sent
                by another device, such as a SMPTE-to-MIDI converter.
                Type in the start frame, which is the SMPTE frame time
                (in hours, minutes, seconds and frames) at which you
                want FreeStyle to begin playing your song. The frame
                time you type in here corresponds to the down beat of
                measure zero (the pickup bar) in your song. Make sure
                that the frame rate setting matches the SMPTE time code
                frame rate of the incoming time code.<font size="3"><br>

                Standard beat clocks</font><br>
              <font size="2">FreeStyle can either follow or generate
                standard MIDI beat clocks. Use the Standard Beat Clocks
                option when you want FreeStyle to slave to standard MIDI
                beat clocks generated by a drum machine or other MIDI
                device (or software). Use the FreeStyle Sends Beat
                Clocks option when you would like FreeStyle to send them
                to another device. The various related settings for beat
                clocks are discussed below.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">Implementations of MIDI
                sync have evolved over the years. As a result, not all
                devices transmit and send MIDI clock signals in the same
                way. FreeStyle provides several options for maximum
                synchronization compatibility with your master device.
                The default settings reflect the most commonly used MIDI
                standards. It is best to leave them set this way unless
                you experience problems when synchronizing.<font

                24 clocks per metronome click / 24 clocks per quarter
                note</font><br>
              <font size="2">Some manufacturers have begun to make
                devices which send 24 clock signals per beat (one click
                of the device's metronome) instead of the standard 24
                clocks per quarter note. This new method is very useful
                when there are meters which do not use the quarter note
                as the beat unit: 3/8, 5/16, etc. In 6/8, for example,
                there might be a metronome click every three eighth
                notes; in 4/1, the metronome would click once every
                whole note. If you were using a less common meter such
                as 5/32 or 3/16 + 4/16, using the quarter note as the
                timing base would not be very useful. Instead, use the
                24 clocks per metronome click option.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font color="#0000a0"><br>
                Start on any clock</font><br>
              <font size="2">When this option is checked, FreeStyle will
                automatically start if it receives a time clock even if
                no start or continue command was received. This option
                is necessary when using some early MIDI devices which
                don't send start or continue commands, only timing
                clocks.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font color="#0000a0"><br>
                First clock is time 1</font><br>
              <font size="2">When this option is checked, FreeStyle
                interprets the first MIDI clock signal it receives as
                the second timing clock of the sequence, 1/24th of a
                beat after the beginning. Devices manufactured recently
                send the first clock signal (time 0) after the start
                command for the sequence. Some earlier devices assume
                the start command to be the first clock signal. The
                first clock signal they send would be 1/24th of a beat
                after the beginning. If you are using one of these
                devices, you should check this option.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">Since manufacturers rarely
                explain this aspect in their documentation, you may not
                know if your device behaves this way. The best way to
                find out is to experiment: set the metronome to the
                slowest possible tempo, play both devices (with
                FreeStyle as slave) and listen for discrepancies in
                attacks and beat alignment. The difference of 1/24th of
                a beat is very audible at a slow tempo. If FreeStyle
                seems slightly behind the master device, try checking
                this option.<font size="3"><br>

                About MIDI synchronization</font><br>
              <font size="2">MIDI Beat Clocks: consist of a continuous
                stream of real-time messages. They are produced by most
                MIDI compatible drum machines and sequencers, and by
                some synthesizers (particularly those with built-in
                sequencers). MIDI beat clocks are transmitted 24 times
                per beat. If the master device changes tempo, the MIDI
                beat clocks slow down or speed up accordingly; any slave
                device will follow this tempo change.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">Start, Stop, and Continue:
                Most devices that generate MIDI beat clocks also send
                Start, Stop, and Continue messages; slave devices will
                start playback, pause, rewind, or play from the current
                location according to the combination of these messages
                received.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">Song Position Pointer: In
                addition, many devices send Song Position Pointer data.
                These messages set the current location for playback,
                much like setting the Counter in FreeStyle.<font

                  FreeStyle performs on your music to spell notes
                  correctly takes time. If you have a slower computer,
                  you can speed up the time it takes FreeStyle to draw
                  notation by turning off (unchecking) Smart Note
                  Spellings. If you would also like this option to be
                  disabled in all newly created documents, uncheck the
                  Smart Note Spellings option in the Notation
                  Preferences dialog (which can be opened by choosing
                  Preferences from the Edit menu). When the Smart Note
                  Spellings option is turned off, FreeStyle still spells
                  notes correctly according to the current key signature
                  and mode (major or minor), but it does not analyze the
                  musical context of the note. In most cases,
                  FreeStyle's choices for note spelling are still quite
                  acceptable, and you can always manually tweak
                  individual note spellings by double-clicking the note
                  and choosing the desired spelling in the Note Detail
                  dialog.<font size="3"><br>

                      command is checked, FreeStyle notates swung
                      rhythms in straight time instead of writing them
                      as triplets. For example, swung eighth notes are
                      customarily written as straight eighth-notes. If
                      you are playing jazz, swing, hip-hop, be-bop, or
                      any type of music that involves a swung feel,

                The text menu commands operate in standard Windows

                same manner as point size, text style, and
                justification. For example, the title might be given the
                First Pages setting, but a page number might be given
                the Body Pages setting. If an item is grayed out, it is
                because it does not apply to the situation; for example,
                if the notation window is currently displaying a
                left-hand page, the Right Pages command is grayed out.
                See the table below for a summary.<br>
              </font>When choosing which pages to display text on, keep
              in mind that FreeStyle has two separate text layouts in
              the notation view: one for instrument parts (used when any
              player is displayed by itself) and another for scores
              (viewing multiple players together). When you display a
              single player by itself, FreeStyle displays the
              single-player text regardless of what player is being
              shown (except for the player's name, which changes to show
              the correct instrument name).</font></font></font></p>

              </font><font size="2">"Under the hood", when you record
                music into FreeStyle, the program actually records MIDI
                data from your MIDI instrument. When you play a note,
                press the sustain pedal, or move your pitch bend wheel,
                your MIDI keyboard sends a stream of numerical MIDI data
                representing your performance to FreeStyle, which
                faithfully records it. Most of the time, FreeStyle frees
                you from this level of technical detail so you can focus
                on your music. However there may be times when it would
                help you to see the MIDI data in its raw, numerical
                form. The <u>Event List</u></font> window does just
              that, giving you precise control over your music.<br>

                size="3"><br>
              </font><font size="2">This preference determines what
                happens when you paste notes into a region of time where
                controller events currently exist, and the notes you are
                pasting have controller events along with them. The
                easiest way to understand this is through an example.
                Let's say that you have copied a section of notes into
                the clipboard. FreeStyle has automatically included some
                volume controllers because they affect the notes you
                just copied. Now you go to paste the notes somewhere
                else, but there happens to be volume controllers at the
                location where you are pasting. When Keep Destination
                Controllers is unchecked, the volume controllers in the
                clipboard are pasted with the notes, and they replace
                the controllers at the paste destination. When Keep
                Destination Controllers is checked, the volume
                controllers in the clipboard are not pasted with the
                notes, and the controllers at the paste destination
                remain unaffected.<font size="3"><br>

                Auto-Select Controllers</font></span><font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">The Auto-Select Controllers feature
              applies musical "intelligence" to MIDI data recorded into
              FreeStyle. When this option is checked, pitch bend, volume
              changes, and other aspects of the musical performance that
              consist of MIDI controller data in the controller pane are
              automatically "linked" to the notes that they affect. As a
              result, you can select move, cut, copy, paste and
              otherwise edit notes, and the controller data is
              automatically included with the notes. This means that you
              don't have to worry about pitch bend or similar data;
              FreeStyle takes care of it automatically for you when you
              edit the notes. The example below shows how the pitch bend
              in the controller pane is selected when the note is
              selected.<font size="3"><br>

          FreeStyle to call up the right sounds on your MIDI instrument,
          there may be one or more settings that you need to make in the
          instrument so that it responds properly to FreeStyle. For

        </font><font size="2">You may be running into the limits of your
          computer's processing power. FreeStyle gives priority to
          sending and receiving MIDI data over most screen redisplays.
          However, with enough of an overload you may hear delays or
          erratic timing in your music. <br>
        </font>Usually the overload is caused by vast reams of
        aftertouch (mono or poly key pressure), controller, or pitch
        bend events in one or more synthesizer tracks.<br>
        To solve the problem, you must reduce the amount of MIDI
        information being sent by FreeStyle in one of the following
        ways:<font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          down the tempo of the sequence during the problem passages. <br>
          &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete unneeded
          aftertouch or other controller data in the controller view.
          (See <u>Controllers</u></font> for more information.)<br>

        </font><font size="2">FreeStyle maps each track inside the SMF
          into a Player. Because of this do not use tracks that contain
          events for different channels. If you have tracks like this,
          pull them apart so that each track only has events for a
          single channel.<font size="3"><br>

            a sound source for FreeStyle, make sure that its "Local
            Control" feature is turned off. Local control makes the keys
            on the keyboard trigger sounds in the on-board synthseizer.
            Since you will be doing this via FreeStyle, you want to turn
            it off in the synth itself. Otherwise, you'll trigger it
            from both the keyboard and FreeStyle, and you'll get doubled
            notes.<font size="3"><br>

            size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2"> When you are setting up a MIDI
            synthesizer or sound module to use it with FreeStyle, the
            goal is to be able to access as many sounds as possible in
            the device by name from within FreeStyle, and to get it to
            play as many different sounds as possible at the same time.<br>
          </font>FreeStyle supports the devices listed in this section
          as best as it can. In order to do so, it assumes that the
          instrument is pretty much like it was when you first pulled it
          out of the box. This is especially true with regard to the
          automatic sound lists that appear for the device within
          FreeStyle. Most General MIDI devices work great with
          FreeStyle--even without any changes to the module itself by
          you. If you've made only a few changes to the instrument's
          settings, it should work fine, as long as you follow the
          recommendations mentioned in this on-line help for the device.
          If you've made substantial changes to the instrument (such as
          changing the internal banks of sounds), the sound lists
          probably won't work.<br>
          Here is a checklist of things you want to look into for a
          device if things don't seem to be working quite right:<font
            size="3"><br>
          </font><font size="2">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make















































































            sure the device you are using is set up for multi-timbral
            operation with a sequencer. There is a wide variety of ways
            that devices handle this, so there is no set rule we can
            recommend here. Check the device's manual. (Many Korg and
            Yamaha devices call it "Multi" mode. Many Roland devices
            call it "Performance" mode.)<br>
            &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FreeStyle
            attempts to use all channels that it thinks are available in
            the device. Some MIDI devices always receive on all 16
            channels. Others can only receive on 8 channels at a time,
            and you can often choose which channels you want to use. In
            addition, many instruments let you turn channels off if you
            want. In general, make sure FreeStyle knows which channels
            are available and which ones aren't. You do this in the
            Studio Setup command in the Setup menu. (If you get the Easy
            Setup window, you may need to click the "Launch Config
            program" button and then double-click on the icon of the
            device that appears.) Double-check the device to make sure
            its settings match what you tell FreeStyle.<br>
          </font>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your
          device is a controller, and you are also using it as a sound
          source for FreeStyle, make sure that its "Local Control"
          feature is turned off. Local control makes the keys on the
          keyboard trigger sounds in the on-board synthesizer. Since you
          will be doing this via FreeStyle, you want to turn it off in
          the synth itself. Otherwise, you'll trigger it from both the
          keyboard and FreeStyle and you'll get doubled notes.<br>
          &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FreeStyle uses
          MIDI system exclusive, bank select, and program change events
          to call up sounds on MIDI devices. Be sure your device is set
          up so that it will respond to these types of messages. If it
          isn't, FreeStyle won't play the correct sounds.<br>
          &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some devices
          can handle drum kits on any receive channel. Others force you
          to use drums on only a particular channel (usually channel
          10). If so, FreeStyle needs to know which channel is reserved
          for drums. For the devices listed in this section, this has
          already been set up for you.<br>
          &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, check
          our web site (www.motu.com) for information about which new
          devices we are supporting. FreeMIDI has a feature called
          "default names files," which are text files that describe the
          stock patch lists for a musical device. If you cannot choose
          your device name in FreeStyle's Easy Setup Window, that means
          that a "default names file" does not exist for your device in
          the FreeMIDI folder within your System folder. However, you
          might be able to download a new default names file and an
          updated Devices.ini file from our web site that will add
          support for your device. The web site also contains updated
          information about how best to set up all supported devices for
          use with FreeStyle. See especially www.motu.com/freestyle.<font

          Tips</font><br>
        <font size="2">If you intend to connect your Alesis keyboard
          directly to your computer using the Alesis Serial MIDI Driver
          and the special cable, the following steps may help you get
          set up more quickly.<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font size="1">1. On your keyboard, find the
          "global" settings (for example, on a QS-6, press "Edit Select"
          and then "Global").<br>
          2. Locate the serial connection speed setting (on a QS-6,
          press either one of the "Page" buttons until you reach the
          "I/O" setting).<br>
          3. Make sure the speed is set to the "38.4" selection (on a
          QS-6, the I/O settings should read "PC 3.84Kbaud"). If this
          speed setting is incorrect, the Alesis Serial MIDI driver will
          not be able to locate your Alesis device.</font><font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">For more information on the Alesis Serial
          MIDI driver, please contact Alesis or your Alesis dealer.<font
            size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font color="#0000a0">Quadrasynth and S4</font><br>
        <font size="2">FreeStyle puts the QuadraSynth/S4 into Mix mode
          automatically. For best results, you should refrain from
          taking the QuadraSynth/S4 out of this mode while using
          FreeStyle. There is no way to choose from which bank, user or
          preset, a program is recalled when FreeStyle sends a program
          change message. Therefore, you will need to manually switch
          the QuadraSynth/S4 to the desired bank, user or preset, before
          selecting a program name from the popup patch list. There are
          multiple possible default patch lists for the QuadraSynth/S4.
          This is because different version of the QuadraSynth/S4 ROM
          contained different factory-installed programs. The current
          list installed is for ROM v 1.07. Contact Mark of the Unicorn
          technical support if you have an older ROM version and want
          the matching default patch lists.<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font color="#0000a0">QS-series (QS-6,QS-7,QS-8)</font><br>
        <font size="2">First, in order to prepare your QS keyboard for
          use with an external sequencer like FreeStyle, do the
          following:<font size="3"><br>
          </font></font><font size="1">1. On the QS keyboard press the
          "Edit Select" button<br>
          2. Press the "Bank -&gt;" (global) button<br>
          3. Press the "Page -&gt;" button and scroll to window "P6"<br>
          4. Press the "Value Up" button until it says "KBD MODE: Out
          01" (Actually, any of Out 01 through Out 16 will work. The
          "NORMAL" setting and the "CH SOLO" settings will not work.)</font><font
          size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="2">When you launch FreeStyle, it will
          automatically put the QS keyboard into "General MIDI Mode". In
          this mode, GM drum kits can be accessed via the Metronome
          and/or by a Player. Regretfully, when in GM Mode, the QS
          ignores any bank select messages that are sent to it, only
          accessing patches in the "Preset Programs 4" bank. You
          therefore should use menu item "Setup \ Player Library \ Edit
          Player Library" in order to edit FreeStyle's Player Library so
          that every player uses a sound in the "Preset Programs 4"
          bank. Once you have done that, all of FreeStyle's metronomes
          and predefined ensembles will work properly.<br>
        </font>Alternatively, you can take the QS keyboard out of GM
        mode. In this mode you will be able to use sounds from all banks
        except for the drum kits bank, and the QS keyboard will accept
        bank select messages from FreeStyle. The only downside of this
        mode is that you'll have to hunt around in the other banks for
        drum kits, and some of FreeStyle's Riff Metronomes may not work.
        To get out of General MIDI mode, follow these steps after
        launching FreeStyle: <font size="3"><br>
        </font><font size="1">1. On the QS keyboard press the "Edit
          Select" button.<br>
          2. Press the "Bank -&gt;" (global) button. <br>
          3. Press the "Page -&gt;" button and scroll to window "P7". <br>
          4. Press the "Value Down" button to select, "General
          MIDI:OFF".</font><font size="3"><br>

            automatically puts the TS-10 into Multi-Mode. If SYS-EX is
            set to OFF, you should set it to ON before using it with
            FreeStyle. To do so press the MIDI Control button until you
            see the page that displays 'SYS-EX = '. You should leave the
            TS-10 in Multi-Mode. Once in this mode, you should make sure
            that each track is assigned a unique MIDI channel from 1-12.
            Note however that in Multi-Mode only the 'Sound Banks' are
            available. YOU WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE 'PRESET BANKS'.<font

                3) If there is an "X" below "PRG", "CTRL" or "EXCL" in
                the MIDI FILTER section, use the Cursor arrow buttons

              want to turn Local Control back ON after you are done

            </font><font size="2">Thirdly, make sure that you have

              MIDI interface outside of the Korg keyboard, follow the
              directions given by the MIDI interface's maufacturer. If
              you are connecting your keyboard directly to your computer
              via the "PC TO HOST" port on the back of the keyboard
              (using the keyboard's internal MIDI interface), then you
              must to the following:<font size="3"><br>
              </font></font><font size="2">1) Press the "Global" button.<br>

              3) Click the right cursor arrow once to highlight "BPS".<br>
              4) Move the value slider until the BPS setting is 38.4

            </font><font size="2">When connecting your keyboard directly
              to the computer, you must also install the KORG MIDI
              Driver before running FreeStyle (see N1/N5 manual chapter
              4, section 2).<font size="3"><br>
              </font></font><font color="#0000a0">N1/N5 Sound Usage
              Restrictions</font><br>
            <font size="2">When using an N1 or N5 keyboard with
              FreeStyle, you must use either all XG sounds, or no XG
              sounds at all. XG sounds are contained in the banks that
              begin with "y:", plus the bank "XG Drums." The reason for
              this is as follows:<br>
            </font>Korg has implemented at least three different types
            of sound banks into these synths. There are Combination
            patches, Program patches, and General MIDI patches. In
            addition to General MIDI, Korg has implemented Roland's
            extended GM format (known as GS), and Yamaha's extended
            format (known as XG). Korg has done this so that a MIDI file
            prepared for any of these formats will get the correct
            patches on the synth (i.e., a Standard MIDI File mapped for
            XG synths will get the right sounds, and a file mapped for
            GS will also get the right sounds). Yamaha XG is a specific
            mode within the synth. In order to access XG sounds,
            FreeStyle has to send a system exclusive message to the
            synth that resets the synth to XG mode. This will happen
            whenever you choose an XG sound for a player in FreeStyle.
            In XG mode, you do not have access to the non-XG sounds in
            the keyboard. Therefore, as soon as you choose an XG sound
            for a player, any other player using a non-XG sound will
            suddenly start playing with an incorrect sound.<font

            <font size="2">FreeStyle automatically puts the X-Series
              into Sequencer Mode. In order for FreeStyle to do this,
              system exclusive data reception must be enabled. To do so,
              press the Global button and use the cursor buttons to
              scroll to page 3D FILTER2 and the EX: field. Press the YES
              button so that EX:ENA is displayed. For best results,
              leave the X-Series in Sequencer mode while working with
              FreeStyle. You must also assign each track, in whatever
              Song is current when you switch to Sequencer mode, to a
              unique MIDI channel from 1-16. To do so after switching to
              Sequencer mode, press the Channel button and use the left
              cursor button to select the Track field. Go through each
              track from 1-16 and assign each a track a unique MIDI
              channel from 1-16. The simplest setup would be to have
              Track 1=channel 1, Track 2= channel 2, Track 3= channel 3,
              etc.<font size="3"><br>

            It is important to install and configure the KORG driver
            prior to launching FreeStyle for the first time. Not doing
            so may result in failed MIDI communication between the X5
            and the computer. If this has happened, delete the file
            called 'fmsprefs' from the FreeMIDI directory, (which is
            located in the Windows directory) and proceed with the
            driver installation/configuration below.<br>
            To install the KORG driver:<font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="1">1. Open the Drivers control panel and
              click the Add button/Select Unlisted or Updated driver in
              the Installed Drivers window and click OK.<br>
              2. At the prompt, insert the FreeStyle disk 1 into drive A
              and click OK.<br>
              3. Select the KORG PC/IF (for X5 series, 05R/W, AG-10)
              driver and click OK.</font><font size="3"><br>

            After restarting Windows you are ready to launch FreeStyle.

            instrument directly connected to this computer...<br>
            Click CONTINUE, and you will be prompted with the Studio

              </font></font><font color="#0000a0">XP-10</font><br>
            <font size="2">There are two ways to connect the XP-10 to
              your computer: either using MIDI cables with a MIDI
              interface (such as the PC-MIDI Flyer, etc.) or directly
              connecting to the PC serial (COM) ports, using a special
              cable (purchased separately from Roland). It is important
              to install and configure the appropriate MIDI driver prior
              to launching FreeStyle for the first time. If you are
              using an interface, install the driver according to the
              manufacturer's instructions, and then read the section
              below, labeled "If You Use a MIDI Interface". If you are
              using the ROLAND serial driver, simply follow the steps
              outlined in the section labeled "If You Use a Serial
              Cable".<br>
            </font>If you have attempted to run FreeStyle before
            installing the appropriate driver, FreeStyle may cause an
            erroneous studio setup document to be created, which will
            result in no MIDI communication between the XP-10 and the
            computer. If this has happened, delete the file called
            'fmsprefs' from the FreeMIDI directory, (which is located in
            the Windows directory) and continue with the driver
            installation/configuration.<br>
            If You Use a MIDI Interface:<br>
            If you use MIDI cables, you will need two MIDI cables and a
            MIDI interface . (Please refer to the section labeled
            "Connections Using MIDI Cables" in Chapter 8 of the XP-10
            manual for details on how to make the proper connections.)
            Set the computer switch on the rear panel of the XP-10 to
            "MIDI". Turn "Local Control" Off on the XP-10. (Please refer
            to the section labelled "Turn off the XP-10's Local Control"
            in chapter 7 of the XP-10 manual for details.) After the
            initial WELCOME! message the program will present you with
            the Studio Setup window, where you tell FreeStyle what MIDI
            gear you have. Click on the drop-down list of devices and
            select XP-10 from the list of supported devices. NOTE: The
            default device is set to "Generic GM". Click the Expand
            button to tell FreeStyle about the device's MIDI
            connections. If you have no other MIDI gear, click DONE.
            Otherwise, click the ADD button to add another device, and
            configure it appropriately. That's all there is to it!<br>
            If You Use a Serial Cable:<font size="3"><br>
            </font><font size="2">If you use a serial cable, connections
              can be made directly to the COM port on the back of the
              PC. (Please refer to the section labeled "Connections
              Using a Computer Cable" in Chapter 8 of the XP-10 manual
              for details on how to make the proper connections.)

              select the appropriate drive to scan, and click OK. After
              the Wizard scans the disk, it should present youwith a

              and then click Finish to have the Wizard install the
              driver software onto your computer. Finally, the Wizard
              should inform you that Windows must be restarted. When you

                Important Note</font><br>
              <font size="2">For the latest help on how to use your
                keyboard or sound module with FreeStyle, go to
                www.motu.com/freestyle.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font color="#0000a0">S30 and S80</font><br>
              <font size="2">First, make sure your keyboard is set to
                receive program changes and control changes:<font
                  size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">1) Press the "Utility"
                button.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">2) Turn the Page knob until
                the "MIDI SW)" page appears.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">3) Set "Bank Sel" to "all"
                and set "PgmChng" to "on," using knobs C and 1.<font
                  size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">Secondly, make sure your
                keyboard's "Local Control" setting is OFF. This prevents
                duplicate notes from sounding while recording in
                FreeStyle. You will want to turn Local Control back ON
                after you are done using FreeStyle, so the keyboard will
                work normally when played by itself.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">1) Press the "Utility"
                button.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">2) Turn the Page knob until
                the "MIDI Ch)" page appears<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">3) Set "Local" to "off"
                using knob 1.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">Thirdly, press the
                "Perform" button on your keyboard to put the synth into
                Performance mode. This is the proper mode to use when
                using your keyboard with a computer sequencer. Twirl the
                data knob until the Performance "INT:128, Master KB," is
                selected. This stock Performance setting works pretty
                well with FreeStyle. For a complete description of how
                to tweak a Performance setting for use with a computer
                sequencer like FreeStyle, see the section in your
                keyboard manual entitled "Using as a Multitimbral Tone
                Generator (Performance Mode)" (S80 manual page 62).<font

                </font></font><font size="2">If you are using an
                external MIDI interface, make sure that the "HOST
                SELECT" switch on the back of your keyboard is set to
                "MIDI." You do not need to install the Yamaha CBX
                driver.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font size="2">If you are connecting your
                keyboard directly to your computer via the "TO HOST"
                port on the back of the keyboard (using the keyboard's
                internal MIDI interface), then make sure that the "HOST
                SELECT" switch on the back of your keyboard is set to
                "PC-2." In this case, you must also install the Yamaha
                CBX driver. See your "Tools for S30/S80 &amp; CS6x/CS6R"
                manual for directions on how to install the driver from
                the Tools CD-ROM that came with your keyboard. When
                installing the driver, do not choose the multiport
                option. Once the CBX driver is installed correctly and
                you have restarted Windows, choose "Studio Setup" from
                the Setup menu in FreeStyle and click on the Device
                Usage button. Make sure that the Yamaha CBX Driver item
                is checked and then click on OK. Click on the "Add"
                button and then use your mouse to change the new "Device
                1" to be a Yamaha S30 or S80. Click on the plus sign to
                the left of the device to reveal the connection
                drop-down lists. Use the mouse to set the MIDI In and
                Out connections to use the CBX driver MIDI Out and MIDI
                In.<font size="3"><br>
                </font></font><font color="#0000a0">CS1X</font><br>
              <font size="2">FreeStyle will automatically place the CS1X
                into Performance mode, allowing you to select
                Performances on MIDI channel 1, and XG patches on MIDI
                channels 5-16. If you would like to modify the patch
                list to enable XG sounds on all 16 MIDI channels, open
                the CS1X default names file (in the Yamaha folder in the
                Default Names folder in the FreeMIDI folder in your
                System Folder) and replace the sysex string for all of
                the XG banks with {f0 43 10 4c 00 00 7e 00 f7}:2 .
                However, this will cause any Performances previously
                selected to be switched to an XG patch. The Performance
                drum kits are only available on MIDI channel 5-16. If
                you have any difficulty selecting patches, make sure the

                  Driver MIDI "ports" or port groups that are

                  as "MIDI interfaces" with friendly names such as "MIDI
                  Express PC", "Roland MPU-401", etc.. For example, all
                  MIDI inputs and outputs published by our driver for
                  the MIDI Timepiece AV will be recognized by FreeStyle
                  and grouped together into one "logical" MIDI interface
                  device that will appear in the FreeStyle's Studio

                  FreeStyle does not recognize a particular MIDI driver,
                  each of the driver's ports will become a separate
                  logical interface within FreeStyle. Such interfaces
                  will use the "raw" name provided by the driver for the
                  actual lone MIDI input or output that the interface
                  represents. You can use these single-port interfaces
                  in the Studio Setup window like any other. That is,
                  even if FreeStyle does not recognize a driver and so
                  can't group its ports as an interface, you will still
                  be able to access the driver's ports in a fairly
                  straightforward manner. (Note that this behavior
                  differs from previous versions of FreeStyle in which
                  the ports of ALL unrecognized drivers were grouped
                  into a single interface named "Windows MIDI",
                  regardless of originating driver.)</p>

                  interfaces and sound cards on the market simply use a
                  standard Microsoft-supplied driver (for example, some
                  MPU-401-compatible cards work with a "stock" Microsoft
                  driver included with Windows, many sound cards can use
                  the standard Sound Blaster driver, etc.). It may be
                  the case that your device is recognized even though
                  your manufacturer does not appear on the list shown in
                  the "Which MIDI drivers are recognized by FreeStyle?"
                  section. For example, your "MegaMIDI 5000" interface
                  card may show up as a "Roland MPU-401" in your system,
                  in which case it will be fully supported by FreeStyle.</p>

                    please run the MOTUDEVR.EXE program (included on
                    your FreeStyle CD-ROM or Disk 1 of your setup
                    diskettes) and follow its instructions. This program
                    collects information about the MIDI drivers
                    installed in your computer and writes a "report"
                    file. While this program itself cannot fix problems,
                    the information in the report can potentially aid
                    our technical support department and can also help
                    us to improve MIDI driver support in future versions
                    of FreeStyle. In fact, we may be able to post
                    interim updates to our Web site (see the "Getting
                    Technical Support" section below) to allow
                    additional drivers to be recognized even before a
                    new version of FreeStyle is released. Even if your
                    MIDI driver is not recognized and an updated version
                    of FreeStyle is not available, you will still be
                    able to access the driver's ports relatively easily
                    (see the "Windows MIDI driver recognition" section).

                        Using QuickRes, change the color depth (for

                              to visually confirm note data before it is
                              entered into the sequence. This is very
                              useful if you are entering some sheet
                              music into FreeStyle. Using a MIDI
                              keyboard, you can hold down a chord and
                              FreeStyle will display that chord in
                              notation on the screen for you instantly.
                              You can check what is on the screen with
                              the sheet music in front of you to confirm
                              that you are entering the right notes. If
                              you don't get it right the first time, you
                              can try some other keys and FreeStyle
                              dynamically updates the chord on the
                              screen. Once you get it right, then you
                              can insert the chord.</font></font></font></span></p>

                              quarter note (ppq). But what if you're
                              used to thinking in terms of 480 ppq? Or
                              what if you'd like to enter a song from a
                              published list of MIDI data, and it uses a
                              resolution of 240 ppq? With FreeStyle
                              Version 2, no problem! The new Event List
                              window Step Controls let you choose any
                              ppq resolution you want for displaying and
                              entering notes. In fact, you can freely
                              change the ppq resolution any time you
                              wish. But rest assured, even if you are
                              displaying and editing notes at 96 ppq,
                              FreeStyle always stores events internally
                              at 960 ppq to capture every nuance of your
                              music. (click image for detail)</font></font></font></span></p>

                              message 0 with a value of 110, it changes

                              you sit down in front of your keyboard and
                              just start playing. No robotic metronome
                              clicks. No countoff. No restrictions. Just
                              you and your inspiration. FreeStyle
                              records your every nuance - both the notes
                              you play and the tempos at which you play
                              them - at the highest resolution available
                              today in any sequencer. The result?
                              FreeStyle lines up its beats and barlines
                              with what you played to produce readable
                              music notation that can be edited without
                              losing the original feel. When you finally
                              use FreeStyle 2.0 yourself, you'll be
                              amazed at how liberating it is. Features
                              like Sense Tempo™ really make FreeStyle

                              you tell the computer where the beats are
                              in your performance. In all cases, these

                              notation window. The Adjust Beats feature
                              lets you drag barlines and beats in
                              FreeStyle's graphic editor to match the
                              notes below, scrubbing the music as you
                              drag so you can easily zero in on the

                              choose to listen to your music with its
                              original tempo and feel, or you can

                              changes in your music, you'll love
                              FreeStyle's new "% variable" tempo
                              feature. It lets you speed up or slow down

                              that already has tempo changes - with a
                              simple adjustment of the tempo slider.</font></font></font></span></p>

                              convenient ways to do so. If you're in a
                              hurry, just click on a barline to insert a
                              meter or key change there. If you want to
                              map out a whole section, use FreeStyle's
                              clearly presented Change Meter or Change
                              Key windows. Want to change the key of a

                              lets you keep the notes at the same pitch

                              correctly in the new key. Or you can

                              still the only sequencer that makes your
                              gear seem to have more MIDI channels than
                              it really has - with sophisticated dynamic
                              channel allocation features. You just
                              choose the sound you want for a player and
                              let FreeStyle worry about the rest.
                              Version 2 builds on this concept by
                              allowing you to lock players to a specific
                              MIDI channel, which is great for working
                              with samplers and other MIDI devices that
                              require specific MIDI channel assignments.</font></font></font></span></p>

                              You could select them by clicking the Add

                        MIDI message can have a value between 0 and 127.
                        Like any MIDI message, a patch change (program
                        change) can only have a value between 0-127
                        (i.e. 000 Piano, or 100 Soft Strings). This is
                        pretty limiting as having only 128 sounds in a
                        synth is not very much. The way synth
                        manufacturers have overcome this limitation is
                        to break sounds into banks or groups of program
                        changes. The bank is therefore accessed by
                        sending one or two controllers, either bank
                        select controller 0, controller 32 or both
                        control 0 and 32. This messages is sent with the
                        program change to access a specific patch in a
                        specific bank. For example, bank 2 may have the
                        bank select control number of 32 with the value
                        of 6. This accompanied with a program change of
                        002 would equal patch 3 in bank 1.</font></font></font></p>

                  and Lyrics - My lyrics line up on the Screen, but not

      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In FreeStyle
        lyrics do not snap to note head positions. Basically, it's a
        text box under your notation view. If you're printing notation
        w/ lyrics, and the print job looks nothing like on the screen,
        there's probably a mismatch between the resolution on your
        printer and on your screen. Adjusting your lyrics to notation at
        a higher resolution in the notation editor can give you the
        results you want.</p>

                  lyrics to notation at high zoom levels like 300% or
                  400% usually gives you good results. If you need
                  lyrics to line up exactly (I mean exactly!!!) use the
                  following formula:</p>
              </font></font></font></font></b><br>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">zoom level = (
        printer DPI / screen DPI (which is generally 72) ) * 100%</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Therefore, if
        your printer is 300 DPI and your screen is 72 DPI, you want to
        line up your lyrics to note heads at a zoom level equal to
        300/72 *100, or 417%. You can type in any zoom level in
        FreeStyle if you choose "Other" from the zoom pop up in the
        notation view.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">You can still
        enter lyrics at the 100% zoom level, or whatever level is
        comfortable to view. Except, before you print, use a higher
        preset zoom level (like 300% or 400%) or the derived zoom level
        (from the formula above) to tweak the spacing between words so
        they line up when printing.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Q: How do I
          set up PatchList Manager so that I can select my synth’s
          patches from the Patch columns in Performer or DP?</b></p>
      <b> </b>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: PatchList
        Manager (PLM) and FreeMIDI (FM) work hand in hand. You must have
        your devices correctly defined in FM for PLM to behave
        predictably. Remember, older synths that do not respond to MIDI
        Bank Select messages will usually only give you access to one
        bank via MIDI.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Here is a
        step-by-step description of how to get PLM working for you so
        that all of your patches show up in the sequencer’s Patch
        columns:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">I. DEFINE DEVICES
        IN THE FREEMIDI DEVICES WINDOW OF PATCHLIST MANAGER</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">As mentioned
        before, PLM will not work if your devices are not defined
        correctly in FreeMIDI. So be sure this has been done before
        continuing.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In PLM, go to the
        FreeMIDI Devices window. If the device does not show up in this
        window, go to the mini-menu, and select “choose devices”, and
        select (darken) the device that you want to add. If there is a
        default patchlist for the device, it will appear in the Patch
        Lists window in PLM. If that is the case, you may be done.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">II. GETTING THE
        PATCH LISTS FOR YOUR DEVICES</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">PLM may not
        contain the current default patchlists for your device. Also, if
        you have changed the RAM (user-definable) patches in your
        device, the PLM default patchlists will not match the patches in
        your device.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">If you have
        Unisyn, do this: In Unisyn, load a bank from your device. Then
        go to PLM and select the device in the FreeMIDI devices window.
        Choose “Load FreeMIDI Patch Lists” from the mini menu. The bank
        should then show up in the Patch Lists window. Do the same
        operation with Unisyn and PLM for each bank of the device until
        you have the patchlists you need.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">If you do not own
        Unisyn, you may be able to get a bank dump from the device from
        within PLM. Select the device in the FreeMIDI Devices window and
        choose “Get Bank Dump”. Only a handful of devices support this.
        This function only works if the Device ID# in FreeMIDI’s Device
        Specification window matches the devices actual Device ID#.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">IIa. TYPING YOUR
        OWN PATCHLISTS</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">If none of the
        above options work for you, the patch lists may have to be typed
        in. This is the case when your device has no default patchlist
        available in PLM, and also when you have no other way to enter
        your device’s bank patchlist. Manually typing a patchlist is not
        fun but it works. Here’s how:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">In PLM, go to the
        Patch Lists window. In the mini menu choose “Add Patch List”.
        Click in the length column to make the bank the correct length
        for the number of patches in the banks of your device. Also
        enter the correct numbering system.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Then add one
        patchlist for each additional bank of sounds that the device
        contains. You can do this by selecting your first patchlist and
        choosing “duplicate” from the mini-menu. Then rename each
        patchlist to correspond to the banks in the device.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now you have to
        type the names of the patches for each patchlist into their
        corresponding positions in each bank. Do it carefully, because
        if you get off by one number or leave a patch out, you may have
        to repeat a lot of your work to correct your error.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Once you’re
        finished typing, you can leave each bank separate or you can
        place them in a folder. If you choose to place the banks in a
        folder, go to the mini-menu in the Patch List window and choose
        “add folder”. Name the folder “SE-1 Patchlists” or something
        descriptive. For more on folders, etc., see next section:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">III. ASSIGNING
        THE PATCHLISTS TO YOUR DEVICE</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sometimes the
        patchlists are present in PLM’s Patch List window but still
        don’t show up in the sequencer’s patch column. The following
        will help assure that things are set up correctly:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Look in the
        FreeMIDI devices window in PLM. Press the arrow to the left of
        the device name to open the list of MIDI channels used in that
        device. These channels correspond to the receive channels you
        have defined for the device in FM. If don’t find the MIDI
        channels that you expect here, go to FreeMIDI Setup and edit the
        receive channels for the device.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Still in the
        FreeMIDI devices window in PLM, click and hold in the Patch
        Lists column next to the first MIDI channel. You will see all of
        the Patchlists and folders that you have entered in the Patch
        List window. Select the folder or patchlist that you want to be
        accessed by that MIDI channel.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">If you want that
        particular channel to access all of the patchlists you’ve
        defined for the device, make sure all of these patchlists are in
        a folder in PLM’s Patchlist window, and select that folder to be
        used by this device MIDI channel. If you want the channel to
        have access to only one patchlist, such as a drum channel, leave
        that patchlist out of the folder and select only that patchlist.</p>

      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">When you
        configure a device in PLM with its defaults, the bank numbers of
        the patchlists usually are set up automatically. However, when
        you type your own patchlists or have configuring problems you
        may need to enter the bank numbers manually.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This is done in
        PLM’s Patch List window. Refer to your synth’s user manual to
        find the correct bank numbers. It would probably be in the MIDI
        chapter somewhere. When you’re done assigning the banks, they
        might look something like this:</p>

      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">This gets pretty
        complicated. The standard formats of bank select are Controller
        #0, Controller #32, both Controller #0 and #32, patch changes
        above 100, or SysEx messages. When using #0, #32 or both, in the
        Bank Select dialog box, bank select properties must be defined
        correctly in FreeMIDI’s Device Specification window for Bank
        Select Formats One Number or Two Numbers to function properly.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">To define program
        change strings or SysEx strings for bank select, use the Set
        MIDI Message dialog box. These will require referring to the
        synth’s user’s manual. If in doubt, refer to the pertinent
        chapters in the Performer or DP manual since it covers the
        procedures in much further depth.</p>

      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">You can confirm
        if you’ve done everything correctly by going to your sequencer
        (Performer or DP) and click and hold in the default patch column
        for one of the devices MIDI channels in the Tracks window. You
        should see all of the patchlists that are assigned to that MIDI
        channel in PLM. If you select a patch and the correct one
        appears in that channel in your synth, then you have done
        everything right. If not, you didn’t!</p>

      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Q: Why are the
          FreeMIDI options in Mosaic greyed out?</b></p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: If the
        FreeMIDI options in the file menu of Mosaic are greyed out, it
        is because Virtual Memory is on. Turn off Virtual memory off in
        the Memory Control Panel, and you will be able to use the MIDI
        features of Mosaic.</p>

          Timepiece with MMC commands from Performer?</b></p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: In order for
        the record message to get through to the ADAT, you must record
        arm a virtual track on the DTP in the MIDI Machine window of
        Performer. To create a track for the DTP in this window, click
        on the DTP, pull down the mini-menu for the MIDI Machine window,
        and select set number of tracks. Set the DTP to have 1 track.
        When you want to punch in with the Record button in DP, make
        sure that the virtual track for the DTP is also record armed.</p>

        patchlist?</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: The current
        version of FreeMIDI contains the patchlists for most of the
        Roland Expansion boards. You will need to copy and paste the
        appropriate lists into the default list for the JV-1080. There
        is an instruction file located in the same folder as the
        Expansion board lists. To find this folder once you have
        installed the current FreeMIDI, follow this path: Open the
        Hard-drive, open the System folder, open the FreeMIDI folder,
        open the Default names folder, and open the Roland folder.
        Inside this Roland folder you will find the Expansion board
        folder and the instructions for using these lists.</p>

          Performer 6?</b></p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: This error
        message refers to the absence of a shared library in the
        extensions folder. This could be caused by using a system
        software earlier than 7.5.3. If you are using 7.5.3 or later,
        this error message probably only means that the SOMobjects
        extension is not active. Try restarting the Mac with only these
        extensions active: FreeMIDI System Extension, FreeMIDI Power
        Plug, Shared Library Manager, Shared Library Manager PPC,
        SOMobjects, Sound Manager, and the MOTU folder.</p>

          there a delay on my audio input in Digital Performer?</b></p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: When using the
        MOTU Audio System and monitoring through effects, a delay will
        be introduced. To avoid this you will have to use direct hardare
        playthrough, and monitor the input with no effects. This setting
        is accessed through the MOTU Audio System options selection
        under the Basics menu. Go to the Input Monitoring Mode, and set
        it to Direct Hardware Playthrough.</p>

          use Unisyn with my MIDI device?</b></p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: Generally the
        "No Reply" error refers to an incorrectly set device ID, or
        signal flow issue. Make sure that the device ID in FreeMIDI
        matches the sysex ID of the instrument. If it does, the sysex
        message may not be making it to the instrument. If the
        instrument has a MIDI receive indicator, does it indicate that a
        message is received when you select a Get Patch from Unisyn?</p>

      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: Yes. To do so
        follow these instructions:</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">1) You will need
        to have FreeMIDI 1.35 installed. In the FreeMIDI preferences,
        select Emulate OMS, Inter-Application MIDI and FreeMIDI
        Applications Only.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">2) Open FreeMIDI,
        and while FreeMIDI is still open, launch Rebirth, then Digital
        Performer.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">3) Open the
        Transmit Sync window from the Basics menu and select Rebirth
        from the Applications option in the MIDI beat clock menu.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">4) Quit Rebirth,
        and re-launch it.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">5) Select Digital
        Performer (or Performer) for the sync input setting in the
        ReBirth Preferences. These are located under the edit menu.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">6) Set ReBirth to
        External MIDI clock. <br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">Pressing play in
        DP will now start ReBirth playing in the background.</p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><br>
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Q: Can I have
          OMS and FreeMIDI extensions active at the same time?</b></p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: Yes. You will
        need to make sure that the preferences are setup correctly to
        allow this. In FreeMIDI, set the preferences under the file menu
        to "Allow other Applications". In OMS, make sure the "Run MIDI
        in background" option is off. This is located in the OMS MIDI
        setup option under the edit menu. Now each application will
        release control of the serial ports when you switch from one to
        the other.</p>

      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Q: All of the
          output lights on my MIDI interface are glowing. Is this a
          problem?</b></p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">A: Yes. This
        would be evidence of a clock loop. A clock loop can cause random
        patch changes, stuck notes, missing notes, etc. There are two
        ways to correct this. You could use the filtering capabilities
        of the MIDI Timepiece, or MIDI Express to filter these messages.
        MIDI clock is a real-time message, so you would want to set the
        filters to filter real-time messages on the inputs of the
        interface. You could also find the parameter that turns the
        clock on or off, and turn it off on the MIDI device that is
        transmitting the clock.</p>

      MOTU Digital Performer, Composer MOSAIC, Freestyle<br>
      Tips &amp; Tricks<br>
      Computer / Software<br>
      Published June 1997<br>
      <br>
      MOTU software specialist and UK distributor Simon Stock passes on
      some useful info for users of Performer, Digital Performer,
      Composer's MOSAIC and Freestyle.<br>
      <br>
      Before we get started with some hints and tips for MOTU software
      users, here's something Mac users can do fairly easily to maximise
      the performance of any Mac application, including Performer:
      increase the amount of RAM that's allocated to the program. The
      default amount of RAM that a program will take is set to be a
      compromise between what the program is really happy with, and what
      it might have to put up with in some systems. Unlike with the
      Atari ST, simply installing more RAM in a Mac does not
      automatically make it available to the programs you run. If a
      program crashes by 'freezing', as opposed to giving an error
      message, it's more than likely that the cause is the application
      running out of RAM. To check how much RAM you have available for
      Performer, boot the computer, then, without running any other
      programs, go to the About this Macintosh option, from the Apple
      Menu (see Figure 1, below). You will see a figure for Free System
      Blocks.<br>
      <br>
      This is the RAM you have left to run any programs, including
      Performer. Make a note of this number, but deduct 300k to allow
      the System a bit of breathing room. Now, select the Performer
      application file and choose Get Info from the file menu (or
      Command‑I). In the window that appears the bottom figure, for
      Preferred, is the one you can change: put in your new figure here.
      Increasing the default amount by 2‑3000k should be more than
      adequate for most people, but I had to allocate 21Mb to Performer
      v5.5 to open someone else's file on one occasion! To check whether
      what you have allocated to Performer is adequate for your own
      needs, when you've loaded one of your own files into Performer you
      can open up the Memory gauge from the Windows menu. As long as you
      have at least 1000k free (2000k in Digital Performer) you're well
      within the safety zone. RAM is much cheaper than it used to be, so
      if you're struggling with what you have currently, it really is a
      worthwhile investment to get some more. One final word on the
      subject: although virtual memory, and particularly RAM Doubler, is
      an excellent way of increasing available memory for standard
      office applications, you cannot use this method for programs that
      depend on real‑time performance, such as Performer.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> Edit Window Track Switching</b><br>
      Here's a little feature that snuck in on Performer v5 that many
      users still do not know about (and I have to keep remembering to
      use). When you're in an Event List, Graphic or Notation (not
      QuickScribe) editing window, and you want to switch to looking at
      another track in the same way, you no longer need to close the
      window, select the other track, then open again. Instead, simply
      hold down the Command key whilst click‑holding on the Track name
      at the upper right of the window: a pop‑up list of all the other
      tracks will appear, and you can just go straight to the other
      track you want to edit.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> Graphic Editing &amp; Controller Information</b><br>
      There are a few neat tricks you can do in the Graphic Editing
      window, once you know the function of a couple of items in the
      window, and one or two ways in which the Option (or Alt) key comes
      into effect.<br>
      <br>
      The first thing I would recommend you do when you open up the
      Graphic Editing window for a track is to maximise its size, by
      clicking on the Maximise button in the title bar. When editing
      controllers (these techniques also apply to Velocity data and
      Pitch Bend), you can drag the divider bar between the controller
      and note display upwards, to give more space for viewing the
      controllers. You can also select between three different scales,
      as appropriate (a 0 to 127 scale, good for volume, a ‑80 to +80
      scale, good for Pitch Bend, and a combination ‑80 to 127 scale),
      by clicking in the scale on the left.<br>
      <br>
      Let's say you want to draw in a continuous MIDI volume change over
      a couple of bars. Firstly, look at the resolution selector towards
      the top right of the window. This tells you the density of the
      data that's going to be created when you drag the pointer. The
      default is quarter‑note (crotchet) resolution, which is too crude
      for a smooth change, so you should probably change this to
      32nd‑note resolution. Next, click on the 'I' Insert Tool in the
      title bar, and select Volume as the type of data you want to draw
      in. Move the cursor (which should now be a cross‑hair) down to the
      controller area, and simply drag horizontally over two bars to
      create the volume change (see Figure 2, above).<br>
      <br>
      Although virtual memory, and particularly RAM Doubler, is an
      excellent way of increasing available memory, you cannot use this
      method for programs that depend on real‑time performance, such as
      Performer.<br>
      The Option (Alt) key allows another way of creating the data. This
      time, hold the Option key down before you select Volume, and keep
      holding it while you drag across two bars in the controller area.
      Now a line appears, with drag handles at each end and in the
      middle. Once the line is created, you can let go of the Option key
      and use the drag‑handles to precisely position the line, or even
      turn it into a curve with the middle drag‑handle. To finally
      create the data, click anywhere in the controller window.<br>
      <br>
      Velocities and controllers already present can be altered using
      the Reshape tool — that's the little squiggly sine‑wave icon. To
      select the data you want to reshape, Option double‑click on one of
      the controller events of the type you want to edit, and all
      controllers of that type will be selected. Now click on the
      Reshape tool, and you can drag across the selected data at the
      height you want to impose on it. Just as when creating controllers
      in the previous example, you can bring in a line with drag‑handles
      to help you edit the data, just by holding down the Option key
      before you select the Reshape tool, then keeping hold of it while
      you create the line. The edit is finally made when you click away
      from the line.<br>
      <br>
      There's another neat trick you can perform in this window: if you
      have a drum track that contains several different drums, but you
      want to alter the velocity of only one of them, double‑click on
      that drum's note in the piano keyboard: all notes of that pitch
      are now selected, along with their velocities, and you can drag
      the velocity level up or down in the controller area (no
      Hyper‑Edit required!).<br>
      <br>
      <b>What Is Patchlist Manager?</b><br>
      This tip refers to Performer, Digital Performer, Composer's
      MOSAIC, and FreeStyle for the Mac.<br>
      <br>
      The FreeMIDI system, introduced with Performer v5.0, provides MIDI
      resources and functionality for all current MOTU programs. Setting
      up FreeMIDI is done from two small applications, FreeMIDI Setup
      and PatchList Manager. FreeMIDI Setup you have to come across
      straight away, as it's here that you create the FreeMIDI
      configuration file that tells your MOTU software what devices you
      have connected to what MIDI interfaces, how many MIDI channels
      each device has, and what properties they have. PatchList Manager,
      on the other hand, deals purely with patch lists; if the patch
      lists that you get automatically from FreeMIDI accurately reflect
      the patch names in your gear, it's possible that you do not
      actually need to use it at all in order to get the most out of
      FreeMIDI patch lists.<br>
      <br>
      When you add devices to your configuration in FreeMIDI Setup, many
      of the synths will automatically be allocated a patch list, made
      up of the original factory sounds for that synth. The information
      for these patch lists comes from files in the FreeMIDI Folder,
      which is tucked away in the System Folder. If you have a unit that
      isn't allocated a factory patch list (instead, you may see Patch
      1, Patch 2, and so on), you can use PatchList Manager to manually
      create your own. Or, if you do have a factory patch list from
      FreeMIDI, but you have altered and renamed some of the patches in
      your unit, you can edit the patch list that FreeMIDI provides to
      reflect the real state of your unit.<br>
      <br>
      When you first run PatchList Manager, you're presented with a list
      of the devices in your FreeMIDI Configuration (see Figure 3,
      above). From this you can choose which devices you would like to
      create or edit a patch list for. There's also an option here to
      use one of several patch list templates — for instance, the
      General MIDI set (this is useful for assigning the GM patch list
      to QuickTime musical instruments). Once you've selected the
      devices you want to create patch lists for, you can create new
      patch lists from scratch in the Patch Lists window. You can
      specify how many patches the list should have, and the numbering
      system used. To make the task of manually entering names a bit
      easier, each time you 'arrow down' the patch list, the next
      program change is sent out, so if the display of your synth is in
      visual range, you just need to glance over at it before entering
      the next name, rather than having to keep switching between
      computer and synth.<br>
      <br>
      If you wish to edit one of the existing default factory lists,
      select the relevant devices in the FreeMIDI Devices window, then
      choose 'Load FreeMIDI PatchLists' from the mini menu. The current
      list assigned to the device by FreeMIDI will appear in the Patch
      List window, ready for you to edit with a double click.<br>
      <br>
      To create a hierarchical display of multiple banks for a device,
      simply make a Folder in the PatchLists window and drag individual
      patch lists into it. The bank numbers needed to switch between the
      multiple banks can be set from 'Set Bank Select' in the Patch
      Lists window mini‑menu, for devices that use the fairly standard
      Controller 0 and/or 32 to switch banks (make sure this corresponds
      with the Properties that are defined for the device in FreeMIDI
      Setup). You should be able to get this information from your
      device's manual.<br>
      <br>
      Some devices use very non‑standard ways of switching between banks
      — for example, older Ensoniq synths like the VFX‑SD use
      high‑numbered Program Change messages to select banks. Fear not:
      by clicking in the MIDI Message column you can specify any MIDI
      message to be sent when a particular bank is selected; basically,
      if it's possible to switch a bank via MIDI, then PatchList Manager
      can do it.<br>
      <br>
      There are, however, some devices that simply do not allow you to
      select all of their patches via MIDI. Emu's Proteus series and the
      Alesis Quadraverb are both examples of devices that have more
      patches than are selectable by their MIDI implementation, and no
      amount of clever programming can change that.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, when you're happy with the patch lists that you've
      created, make sure that you've assigned the new lists, or folders
      contining multiple lists, to the devices and modules (ie.
      multitimbral parts of a device) in the FreeMIDI Devices window. By
      now, you should see that PatchList Manager gives you the power to
      create any patch list for any device, looking just the way you
      want it to.<br>
      <br>
      <b>To Chunk Or Not To Chunk?</b><br>
      The addition of the new Mixing Board in Performer v5.5 (already in
      Digital Performer since v1.6), and the way in which Digidesign's
      DAE places a limit on the number of virtual tracks available at
      one time, means that the usefulness of using Chunks to arrange
      multiple sequences should be considered against the benefits of a
      wholly linear approach to sequencing. The Mixing Board is derived
      directly from the tracks of a sequence, so if you have multiple
      sequences (ie. Chunks), you have multiple Mixing Boards — not
      impossible to work with, but not as straightforward as having one
      overall desk, as in the real world. The limited number of virtual
      tracks available from the DAE means that by duplicating audio
      tracks in multiple Chunks, you're likely to run into this limit
      sooner rather than later. The good news is, now that Markers are
      fully integrated into the Tracks Window, many of the advantages of
      using Chunks are available directly in that window: for example,
      you can select a whole section, one Marker to the next, simply by
      clicking on the Marker above the tracks; the selected section can
      now be removed (Snip command), copied, cut, or whatever, while you
      get the benefit of one Mixing Board, and better use of virtual
      audio tracks — plus it'll be much easier to export any of your
      works as a MIDI File.<br>

      <b>MOTU FreeStyle</b><br>
      Apple Notes<br>
      Computer / Software<br>
      By Martin Russ<br>
      Published October 1994<br>
      <br>
      Martin Russ brings you the latest Apple news, starting with MOTU's
      new Freestyle package.<br>
      <br>
      Mark of the Unicorn are breaking new ground with their
      recently‑announced FreeStyle sequencer. Whereas most other music
      software companies have only one sequencer, MOTU now have
      Performer (and its direct‑to‑disk big brother, Digital Performer),
      and FreeStyle. And don't expect corner‑cutting: Freestyle isn't
      just a cut‑down or simplified version of Performer — instead, it
      takes a completely different approach to the way that musicians
      work with a computer. Freestyle seems to be based around
      improvisation and jamming, with automatic looping, instant riffs
      and a 'trackless' environment.<br>
      <br>
      And this poses an interesting question: how far along the route of
      adding features should a sequencer go? Should the designers
      continue to incrementally improve the user interface of their
      flagship products until they are so complicated that you can in
      theory do almost anything (but in practice only when you have
      taken the considerable time necessary to learn about them), or
      should they use their experience to produce products that are
      optimised for particular ways of working? Freestyle certainly
      seems to be the latter, since it looks and feels very unlike
      Performer, and is instead rather similar to some of MOTU's
      competitors!<br>
      <br>
      Freestyle also concentrates on immediacy and ease of use (words
      which don't usually come to mind in most reviews of sequencer
      software!). A sequencer is often regarded as a tool for a
      nit‑picking techno‑perfectionist, who can tweak a lacklustre
      performance into a gem, given enough time. But Freestyle aims to
      capture that idea for a riff that flashes momentarily through your
      mind, and which all too often gets lost forever while you set up
      the sequencer...<br>

      </b><b>MOTU Freestyle</b><br>
      Sequencing Software <br>
      Computer / Software<br>
      By Mike Collins<br>
      Published January 1995<br>
      <br>
      Mark of the Unicorn have taken a brand‑new look at sequencing for
      their latest package, FreeStyle, which is aimed at entry‑level
      users as well as musicians who would rather avoid most of the
      complexities of MIDI. Mike Collins checks it out.<br>
      <br>
      The latest MIDI sequencing software from Mark of the Unicorn,
      FreeStyle, offers a fairly radical departure from the established
      norms we've come to expect in this field. The program uses a
      so‑called 'trackless' approach to sequencing, one of the main
      advantages of which is that you can use both linear and
      pattern‑based recording and playback, and seamlessly switch
      between them. So, for example, a bass part made up of several
      different sections joined together in an arrangement will be
      visible in its entirety on the screen, and more importantly, on a
      notation printout.<br>
      <br>
      Since MOTU's new sequencer is so different from the company's
      other high‑profile sequencing program, Performer, product
      specialist Simon Stock, from MOTU's European distributors Klemm
      Technology, came over to my house before I started the review, in
      order to take me through the main features of the program. Here's
      the gist of what he told me.<br>
      <br>
      FreeStyle uses Mark of the Unicorn's FreeMIDI system as its basis
      for controlling your MIDI equipment. Most of the time you will not
      be aware that you are using it, as FreeMIDI deals with where to
      route MIDI data in your setup. When the program is first run, it
      scans your Mac's serial ports for MIDI interfaces; if it finds a
      standard MIDI interface it will take you into the 'Easy Setup'
      window; if it finds something like a MIDI Time Piece or Studio 4,
      it presumes you have a more complex system, and so takes you into
      'FreeMIDI Setup'.<br>
      <br>
      With FreeStyle you don't even need to worry about MIDI channels —
      the program dynamically allocates them, much as modern synths
      dynamically allocate polyphony. This is because FreeStyle employs
      a 'Player Library' — a list of instruments that you use in your
      music, together with preferences for them, such as which sound to
      use on which synth, and what clefs and staves the chosen
      instruments should have in the notation window. So if you select
      'Piano' in FreeStyle, a patch change is generated on the first
      available (unused) channel for the synth it is going to trigger;
      FreeMIDI deals with where to send that message, as it knows what
      port and cable each synth is connected to.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Getting Started</b><br>
      When you create a new file in FreeStyle, the first thing it asks
      you to do is to select an 'Ensemble' to work with. Ensembles are
      different groups of Players (just like in real life), and
      FreeStyle includes some pre‑defined Ensembles, though you can edit
      and create your own Ensembles freely. So instead of being
      presented with a blank canvas of empty tracks, you have already
      made a conscious decision about what type of music you're going to
      write.<br>
      <br>
      The first thing many sequencer users do when starting a new piece
      is to bang out a basic drum part on their keyboard, then quantise
      and loop it before adding the other parts. To save you the bother
      of doing this each time, FreeStyle has a built‑in 'Riff Metronome'
      as an alternative to the standard metronome. This contains a
      number of pre‑recorded drum beats that you can use as the basis
      for your track, and which can be played on any instrument in your
      system. You can customise and edit these later on, by using the
      'Become Player' command, which creates a new Player with the
      actual notes in a loop.<br>
      <br>
      General MIDI is an attempt to simplify things for musicians, and
      FreeStyle is another step along this path. The two work very well
      together.<br>
      Each Player can record any number of takes, which you can then
      switch between using a pop‑up menu. This is ideal if you are the
      sort of person who wants to try out half‑a‑dozen ways of playing
      an idea, and then sort out the most suitable one later. Although
      you could do this on a conventional sequencer, the trackless
      format means that takes are grouped with the player that recorded
      them, so you do not have to perform a lengthy sequence of
      mute‑unmutes to switch between three different versions of a bass
      line.<br>
      <br>
      FreeStyle even deals transparently with the headache of music in
      the bars leading up to and just after a section. Every section
      includes 'Pick‑Up' and 'Overhang' measures that are part of that
      section, so you don't need to copy down‑beat cymbal crashes to the
      first bar of all your verses — the software takes care of this for
      you! Another useful feature, Auto‑Loop record, automatically
      senses when you stop playing — again helping you to put your music
      together, rather than forcing you to become a computer operator.<br>
      <br>
      Having recorded a number of sections, you can choose to chain them
      together in the Arrangement Window, which is a standard graphical
      representation of blocks of music. FreeStyle allocates a letter of
      the alphabet to each section, so setting up a standard
      Verse‑Verse‑Chorus‑Verse‑Chorus arrangement is as simple as typing
      A‑A‑B‑A‑B. Sections can be layered on top of each other, and
      freely moved, lengthened and shortened in this window.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Editing And Notation</b><br>
      FreeStyle makes maximum use of the Mac's graphic and colour
      abilities. For instance, in the Grid Edit window, different
      players are distinguished by their colours, and higher velocities
      are represented by deeper shading of that colour. Notes that are
      'original' and notes that are repetitions of a loop are
      distinguished by being round or square respectively. The volume
      and pan controls in the Ensemble window also have a very slick
      feel to them — another sign of the attention to detail which has
      gone into the interface design.<br>
      <br>
      The Grid Edit window allows conventional manipulation of notes by
      dragging them up and down to change pitch, sideways to change
      their time position, or dragging the right end to lengthen or
      shorten the note. You can zoom in and out on both axes, and the
      display shifts its zoom setting as you move the mouse. And the
      'Zoom‑to‑Fit' feature allows you to option‑select a group of
      notes, while the zoom setting changes so that the selected notes
      fill the whole window, for the most efficient view of them.<br>
      <br>
      You can also display a Controller Edit window at the bottom of the
      Grid Edit window, and this can show any MIDI controller data,
      colour‑coded for the different players. Here, the pencil, line,
      and curve tools allow for easy creation or editing of controllers
      or velocity, and the scale automatically changes to suit the type
      of controller being edited; so, for example, if you select MIDI
      Volume, you get a 0‑127 scale, and if you select Pitch Bend, you
      get a scale with positive and negative values. This feature offers
      an easier way to create a velocity fade across multiple parts than
      in most other MIDI sequencers.<br>
      <br>
      Music notation in FreeStyle is generated by MOTU's own QuickScribe
      TrueType font, so there is no need for any extra utilities in
      order to get accurate print‑out on non‑Postscript printers. The
      notation page shows the music in a page view that scrolls as you
      play back. Here you can view or print as many Players as you like,
      and two page layouts are offered — one for individual parts, and
      one for full scores. Transposing instruments are pre‑defined in
      the Player Library, so every time you use a Saxaphone, the
      notation part is shown in B flat — you don't have to set this each
      time. Yet another musician‑friendly feature.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Remote Ideas</b><br>
      FreeStyle encourages you to use MIDI remote controls to operate
      it, by devoting a colourful graphic window to setting up of these
      remote controls, rather than the usual list of events and
      commands. Most sequencers offer some kind of MIDI remote control
      facility, which is extremely useful in setups where space prevents
      the MIDI keyboard and the computer from being right next to each
      other. The usual problems here are that you forget which key is
      mapped to which control, and keys that are mapped to a control
      cannot then be used for recording MIDI notes. FreeStyle gets
      around these problems, firstly by shipping with a strip of sticky
      labels to affix to your keys, and secondly by using 'trigger' keys
      to activate the remote controls. The default trigger is a 'clump'
      of the bottom three notes on the MIDI keyboard, which have to be
      held down, much as an option or shift key on a computer keyboard,
      whilst pressing the remote key.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, if you want to import MIDI files, FreeStyle will let you
      read Type 1 MIDI Files, although at the moment only the initial
      tempo is supported. Balloon Help and graphic on‑line help are also
      included, and a one‑hour tutorial video is supplied with the
      software, which is great for anyone who hates manuals.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Freestyle In Action</b><br>
      I tried to be ambitious at first, and set FreeStyle up in my main
      programming room, with my Opcode Studio 4 linked to my MOTU MIDI
      TimePiece I — with both feeding my synth rack. Most of the synths
      I have in my rack are neither General MIDI, nor do they
      dynamically allocate polyphony. This immediately made things
      difficult to sort out, but I struggled bravely with the FreeMIDI
      Setup and the PatchList Manager for a couple of hours before
      deciding to give up on this particular route.<br>
      <br>
      Luckily, I had a General MIDI synth module rigged up in the next
      room with a Macintosh Quadra 950, so I installed FreeStyle,
      plugged everything up, set up a basic FreeMidi document with one
      keyboard and the General MIDI module, then loaded up one of the
      demo files which came with the package. All I had to do was press
      play. The software had automatically configured everything
      correctly to play back on the synth module, without me having to
      set up anything in FreeStyle.<br>
      <br>
      I started to see what FreeStyle was all about — taking the 'sweat'
      out of sequencers for entry‑level/musician users with General MIDI
      modules.<br>
      Now I could choose from a pop‑up list of the actual sounds in the
      module for every Player in the Ensemble window, to try out
      different sounds. This was more like it! I started to see what
      FreeStyle was all about — taking the 'sweat' out of sequencers for
      entry‑level/musician users with General MIDI modules.<br>
      <br>
      Keen to try out recording, I chose a Jazz Band setup of Tenor Sax,
      Vibes, Piano, Bass and Drums, and started to improvise right away,
      while I switched between Players in the Ensemble Window. This was
      inspiring in its simplicity, and I found myself getting much more
      creative — through not having to think about the computer as much
      as I usually do. The Graphic Edit Window showed the notes
      on‑screen as I played them, so I switched to the Notation window
      to try this out. Unfortunately, the Notation window would not
      update and redraw quickly enough to display the notes in real‑time
      like the other window.<br>
      <br>
      Then my friend Keith O'Connell, a professional musician and
      programmer, dropped by and decided to try out the Remote Controls.
      After spending just a few minutes customising a set of these to
      suit himself, Keith printed out the Remote Controls window and put
      this printout near the Yamaha DX5 he was using as the MIDI master
      keyboard. Suddenly, comments like "This is brilliant!", and "You
      can do everything from the keyboard!" started to emerge as I typed
      this review in the next room. Then the music started happening as
      Keith pounded away crazily at the keyboard, barely pausing for a
      breath between swapping Players! And this is how another
      masterpiece was born — sounding like a whole jazz band in action,
      where a solitary click had been playing just a few minutes
      beforehand.<br>
      <br>
      I just had to tear myself away from frantically trying to finish
      this review before the looming deadline and take a look at what
      was going on. It seems that once you've set up your remote
      keyboard controls the way you like, you can then simply sit down
      and do whatever you want to do from the keyboard. For instance,
      you can jump between Players while you're recording, and decide
      whether to keep or undo a take while you're building your
      arrangement up. This lets you concentrate on the business of
      putting your music together, without getting embroiled in all the
      fiddly stuff with the mouse and keyboard, as you can often do with
      other sequencers.<br>
      <br>
      Keith explained that, for him, the tie‑ups between General MIDI,
      FreeMIDI, the Players and the Remote Controls definitely removed
      many of the things which can get in the way of your creativity
      while working out musical ideas. He added: "I could see myself
      quickly getting a new arrangement sketched out using this setup,
      and then transferring to Performer running a large MIDI rig, so I
      could use the more advanced editing features on Performer to work
      on the finer details of the arrangement and production." This was
      a useful piece of feedback from a busy professional, who regularly
      works on TV sessions.<br>
      <br>
      To get another different perspective, I asked my girlfriend Sia,
      who is doing a module on Digital Audio at Middlesex University, to
      try FreeStyle. Sia can play a little guitar, but is neither a
      keyboard player nor a schooled musician. She represents an
      absolutely entry‑level user getting started with computer
      sequencers for the first time. Sia recorded a short piece using
      simple bass and snare drum, bass guitar, organ chords, and piano
      melody, and was amazed at how easy it was to quantise everything
      to correct for timing slips, and move a wrong note to the correct
      pitch by pointing, clicking and dragging it in the Graphic Editor.
      She had thought that it would be impossible for her to get it
      right with her limited keyboard skills, and couldn't believe how
      perfect it sounded when it was all corrected with just a few
      simple edits. She commented: "It's so simple you just can't fail
      with it! You can put stuff together just seconds after you boot up
      the program. I could never feel happy working with numbers in an
      event list, but I just loved being able to grab the notes, move
      them around in time or up and down in pitch graphically on the
      screen." So, there you have it — a pretty good endorsement of
      FreeStyle from two people at opposite ends of the spectrum of
      musical skills.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      General MIDI is an attempt to simplify things for musicians, and
      FreeStyle is another step along this path. The two work very well
      together. If you have a small setup with one or two General MIDI
      synths, a sampler, a drum machine, and a MIDI‑controllable effects
      unit and mixer, FreeStyle is the perfect complement at beginner to
      intermediate level. For professional work, it is not really a
      choice I could recommend at present, as it lacks SMPTE sync, Event
      List editing, and many other features which are essential for
      power users. And the Dynamic MIDI Allocation system can be a real
      pain if you have any older synth modules which do not support
      General MIDI or dynamic polyphony allocation. FreeStyle expects
      these things as the norm, and can make life pretty difficult for
      you if you are using synths which do not comply.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of preset collections or Ensembles of Players appealed
      very much, though. And I particularly liked the idea of pickup and
      overhang bars. I also liked the musical metronomes, as I am
      definitely one of those people who prefer something more musically
      stimulating than a metronome click to play along to when I'm
      putting ideas together. The Controller Edit window is similar to
      the one in Opcode's Vision. It's one of the neatest features for
      me, and one which I really miss when I'm working with other
      sequencers; I must also mention that the implementation of the
      Controller Edit window is every bit as good as the one in the much
      more expensive Vision software. The manual also deserves a special
      mention, as it is exceptionally good, and makes great use of
      pictorial explanations with notes.<br>
      <br>
      All‑in‑all, I found FreeStyle very appealing, both visually and
      functionally, and can definitely recommend it as an excellent
      alternative to competitors such as Opcode's MusicShop or Cubase
      Lite for entry‑level users or those who don't want to concern
      themselves with the more technical aspects of MIDI sequencing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Trackless Taste</b><br>
      MOTU product specialist Simon Stock explains the approach of
      FreeStyle in his own words:<br>
      <br>
      "FreeStyle is a new way of sequencing. Instead of presenting the
      musician with an analogy of a recording studio, as most sequencing
      software does, with Tracks and Channels, FreeStyle uses musical
      terms such as Player, Ensemble, Take and Arrangement. The key to
      this is that FreeStyle is a 'trackless' sequencer. By getting
      tracks and channels 'out of your face', FreeStyle acts as a
      creative tool, rather than a production tool like Performer. There
      is no event list editing, no MIDI Machine control, and no SMPTE
      sync — although you can sync to MIDI clock. Instead, you get a
      very slick program geared for writing your music."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pros</b><br>
      Innovative new approach to sequencing.<br>
      Visually appealing.<br>
      Works well with General MIDI synths.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cons</b><br>
      No Event List Editor.<br>
      Problems when using older, non‑GM synths.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><br>
      A very novel and reasonably‑priced take on the computer sequencer,
      FreeStyle is an excellent tool for those who want the power of a
      computer sequencer but don't wish to be bogged down with the finer
      points of MIDI.<br>

      PC Sequencer<br>
      Computer / Software<br>
      By Paul Nagle<br>
      Published January 1996<br>
      <br>
      This unconventional sequencer program aims to let musicians work
      like musicians rather than computer programmers, and has already
      met with an enthusiastic response in its original Mac version.
      Paul Nagle hand‑picks his virtual musicians and gets jamming.<br>
      <br>
      Formed in 1980, and specialising mostly in Mac software, Mark Of
      The Unicorn have only recently taken the plunge into the icy
      waters of the PC market. Their first Windows sequencer, FreeStyle,
      already has an excellent reputation on the Mac (see review in SOS
      January '95) and in many ways mirrors the philosophy of that
      computer: it takes care of all the complicated stuff in the
      background, letting you concentrate on the business in hand.
      FreeStyle differs from most of its competition by being a
      'trackless' sequencer — well, sort of. Music is composed using
      'Ensembles' — hand‑picked collections of musicians who each record
      their efforts into 'Takes'. It is these Takes which roughly
      correspond to the tracks of other programs.<br>
      <br>
      Typically with FreeStyle, music is created in sections which are
      assembled into a finished composition using the graphic Arrange
      window. You can, however, record in a linear fashion within the
      Arrange window, or mix and match both methods. Personally, I like
      this kind of freedom, and found assembling the bare bones of a
      composition incredibly fast and intuitive. If you're expecting
      just another software emulation of a multitrack tape recorder,
      FreeStyle might be a bit of a surprise, its feel being more
      'musician' than 'sound engineer'.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Setting Up</b><br>
      The program is supplied on three high‑density 3.5‑inch disks, with
      a handy set of keyboard stickers included for labelling remote
      control keys. The manual is clear and warrants a thorough read,
      despite the program's simplicity. Installation was only hampered
      by the baffling way in which FreeStyle chooses to refer to MIDI
      ports. Oddly, it has specific, built‑in knowledge about some
      interfaces (none of mine, alas), or you may choose the more
      traditional options of Multimedia Windows drivers. MOTU take the
      liberty of writing loads of stuff to the Windows directory under
      the sub‑directory FREEMIDI — this contains information about many
      popular synths, and can be customised to communicate with
      FreeStyle about instruments it does not recognise, or for user
      patch lists. If you have more than one MIDI port, you need to work
      out which is which by trial and error, since FreeStyle refers to
      them only as Windows MIDI Output 1, Windows MIDI Output 2, and so
      on. At this point you realise that FreeStyle is not designed for a
      large MIDI rig. If you're setting up a single General MIDI synth,
      it's a piece of cake; and other configurations are possible, they
      just take a little longer. It would be a useful future enhancement
      if FreeStyle could be made to work in tandem with MOTU's own
      Unisyn universal editor/librarian program and take all patch and
      instrument definitions from there.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>In Use</b><br>
      Having selected your virtual Ensemble, either from the supplied
      list or by creating a new band from scratch, you record your music
      in sections which loop round, drum machine‑style. Notes played in
      pickup or overhang measures are recognised and handled
      automatically by the program, so that loops run smoothly even when
      you play 'grace' notes. Each musician in the Ensemble can record
      multiple Takes, making it easy to put down several different solos
      and pick the best later.<br>
      <br>
      Once several sections have been recorded, they can be dragged into
      position on the Arrange window. From here you can play the full
      song, overdub new Takes or, by double‑clicking on a section, get
      down to some detailed editing. As a section can be referenced
      multiple times, any changes made to it will be reflected in each
      occurrence. A handy Copy Section command allows for easy creation
      of variations.<br>
      <br>
      FreeStyle provides two ways of graphically editing your music. The
      'piano roll' features as many or as few of your musicians as you
      wish to see, with coloured representations of controller events
      displayed alongside the notes they affect. You can quickly zoom in
      and out of selected areas by holding down the control key as you
      drag over notes, and all the usual move, copy and delete actions
      are available. If you need to edit down to individual note level,
      a double click takes you to 'note detail'.<br>
      <br>
      Whilst not attempting to compete with full‑blown scoring programs,
      FreeStyle's score editor provides acceptable notation editing and
      printing for most everyday uses, allowing text to be placed
      anywhere on the page, clefs and transposition to be defined for
      each Player in the Ensemble, and new notes to be painted in or
      scrubbed out. Notation screen updates were pretty slow, and I
      tried to keep the number of Players displayed to a minimum to
      overcome this.<br>
      <br>
      Overall, I'd say there were enough editing options here to keep
      any but a dedicated technophile happy, and I only really missed a
      MIDI event list because I've become used to having one.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Bits 'N' Pieces</b><br>
      FreeStyle's Quantise menu, with its time offset and swing options,
      offers sufficient flexibility for most uses, my own included,
      whilst the Transpose menu speaks in familiar musical terms, such
      as "transpose up a minor third" — no need to count semitones here.<br>
      <br>
      The metronome is wonderful. It can be a drum riff, selected from
      those supplied or one of your own. This banishes the 'tap tap tap'
      blues and is something every sequencer should have. It doesn't
      have to be a drum riff, either — it could be anything from a
      bassline to a sequence or arpeggio.<br>
      <br>
      Using the Remote control feature, entire compositions can be
      created without needing to constantly touch the computer keyboard.
      Activated by a given controller or 'Key Clump' of notes (which you
      would never normally play), this feature lets you record multiple
      Takes, switch Players, turn on loops, and so on. Great stuff.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, communication with the outside world is possible using
      the synchronisation menu. FreeStyle will accept or transmit MIDI
      clock information, and since it currently lacks any form of tempo
      map, you may find it more convenient to drive it from a drum
      machine. The program reads and writes standard MIDI files, with
      the restriction that only the first tempo event is recognised on
      import.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      Priced at £149, FreeStyle has some tough competition from
      Mastertracks Pro, Micrologic and Cubasis, yet it has enough
      individuality to set it apart from these. The 'trackless' approach
      may be appreciated by those musicians without a studio background,
      and the neat way FreeStyle manages Players and Ensembles would be
      of benefit to anyone trying to get the most out of a General MIDI
      module. I'm told a tempo map facility is high on the list of
      future enhancements, but in the meantime the only way of including
      accelerandos or ritardandos is to play them manually, ignoring the
      program's tempo (and bar lines). If your music usually hammers
      along relentlessly at the same speed, this won't be a problem, but
      I found it quite frustrating. My only other complaint relates to
      the sluggish rate at which the screen updates — especially in
      notation view. My 486 DX2‑66 machine has 16Mb of RAM and handles
      other screen‑intensive programs such as Cubase Score very well,
      but FreeStyle, at times, seemed to go into a time warp...<br>
      <br>
      Glib summing‑up time: I'd say that FreeStyle was designed for
      musicians who don't want or need to get deeply involved with the
      fiddly bits of MIDI, but just want to make music. Well‑suited to a
      small studio, it would also be an ideal 'scratch pad' in a larger
      system.<br>

      <br>
      <b>Pros</b><br>
      The friendly face of MIDI recording.<br>
      Designed for musicians, not technicians.<br>
      Probably the easiest way to knock up those General MIDI ditties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cons</b><br>
      No tempo map.<br>
      Screen updates can be slow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><br>
      With a heavy bias towards General MIDI, FreeStyle manages to keep
      the musician in touch with the business of recording music without
      (almost) all that techie stuff. An elegant interface with some
      nice features means that this could be far more than just a
      beginners' sequencer.<br>

      If you feel that the average sequencer makes you take off your
      musician's head and put on your computer programmer's head, take a
      look at FreeStyle. Derek Johnson is not a number, he's a free
      man...<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes, computers and music — or should that be musicians? —
      just don't mix. No matter how sophisticated the software, some
      players have a mental block towards, or no desire to interact
      with, computers. Athough they can see that computers, allied with
      MIDI‑equipped synths, might have something to offer, the tyranny
      of the metronome bleep, the reliance on a glorified typewriter
      keyboard, and the general pain in the mouse weigh against making
      the move. If only software could be written to work the way
      musicians work...<br>
      <br>
      Mark Of The Unicorn's FreeStyle sequencer set out to address this
      very situation. This essentially trackless sequencer software has
      been reviewed in these pages before (Mac version January 1995, PC
      version January 1996), but has undergone a number of revisions
      since then. FreeStyle's environment offers a choice — or mix — of
      linear and pattern‑based sequencing. And rather than presenting
      you with a track list, as other software does, FreeStyle uses the
      concepts of Players and Ensembles. A Player can be thought of as a
      member of a virtual musical band or group, which is itself dubbed
      an Ensemble. The software comes equipped with a large collection
      of Players, cyber equivalents of guitarists, violinists, drummers
      and so on, each with instructions for which instrument (patch)
      they'll be playing, on which synth attached to your MIDI
      interface. Likewise, FreeStyle has a preset collection of
      Ensembles, such as Big Band, Orchestra, and so on, which bring
      together Players of instruments suited to the Ensemble. The
      collection of Players in an Ensemble does look a little like a
      traditional track list, but there is no MIDI channel to worry
      about: MIDI resources are assigned dynamically.<br>
      <br>
      You have the freedom to define your own Players and Ensembles, and
      you don't have to stick with 'traditional' instrumentalists: a
      Player could easily be a virtuoso fat squelchy bass soloist, for
      example, assigned to play a fat squelchy bass sound on a physical
      modelling synth, and your Ensemble could include several fat
      squelchy bass Players, along with a Player assigned to a TR808
      drum kit. Players aren't even restricted to single voices, but can
      be complex layers of several patches from several synths.<br>
      <br>
      The software also allows you to record performances without a
      metronome (it senses the tempo of your playing, and generates a
      sophisticated tempo map) and comprehensively edit and manipulate
      your performance. It performs virtually real‑time transcription of
      your playing and has plenty of score‑printing options. And
      FreeStyle's remote‑control features allow you, as the manual says,
      to record an entire song without ever touching your computer.<br>

        Windows On The World</b><br>
      MOTU's software has always benefited from the company's approach
      to layout and appearance, and FreeStyle is no exception. The main
      page might look superficially similar to other sequencers, but
      each section is doing its job slightly differently.<br>
      <br>
      <b>There are four main Palettes (MOTU's term) and windows:</b><br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>The Control Palette:</b> <br>
      Apart from standard sequencer transport controls and counter
      display, this window contains metronome and tempo controls. It's
      here that you get the first clues to how FreeStyle is going to
      behave: a Record Mode pop‑up menu offers three choices: Play to
      Metronome, Sense Tempo and Sense Tempo Swing. The second option
      lets you record a rubato performance — ie. free of the metronome —
      that will both play back accurately and, along with the help of
      one or two other parameters, display cleanly in the score window.
      The third option should be used if you're likely to play with
      swing (if you're a jazz player, for example).<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>The Ensemble Palette: </b><br>
      This palette is central to FreeStyle's 'tracklessness'. Rather
      than presenting the horizontal track list found on nearly every
      other sequencer, FreeStyle here allows you to assemble your
      Ensemble of Players, each with their own instrument, level and
      pan‑position controls, and mute and solo buttons. A Player is
      defined in the Player Library, and consists of a name, a sound (a
      pointer to the synth and patch used by the Player) and sundry
      parameters such as actual and display transpose values and clef.
      As I mentioned earlier, you don't need to give a Player his/her
      own MIDI channel, as FreeStyle actually allocates MIDI resources
      dynamically. You can, of course, fix a MIDI channel to a Player,
      but you only need to bother with this if your MIDI equipment can't
      cope with the dynamic assignment. Also critical to the Ensemble
      Palette is the concept of Takes, which are rather like sequence
      tracks. You can record an unlimited number of Takes for each
      Player (subject to your computer's RAM, of course), but only one
      can be played at a time. The current Take is selected by a pop‑up
      menu next to the Player's name.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>The Document Window: </b><br>
      This display actually does double duty: it shows either the
      Graphic Editor (the familiar piano‑roll display) or the Notation
      Window. As with other MIDI sequencing software, individual notes
      can be edited, moved or inserted in either window. You can also
      choose to select a MIDI controller window in the Graphic Editor,
      which allows pitch‑bend, pan, aftertouch and other controller data
      to be easily edited with the mouse; the tempo map can also be
      displayed here. Notes can be double‑clicked, to reveal a dialogue
      box with a full list of parameters (location, velocity, length,
      and so on), which is great for precise editing; double‑clicking on
      a note in the keyboard display running down the left of this
      window highlights all the notes in your song or 'Section' (part of
      a Song — more on this shortly). One thing that might take some
      getting used to is the way all the data for all currently selected
      Players is shown at once; luckily, both notes and controller data
      are colour‑coded in the Graphic Editor, and parts are organised in
      a logical score format in the Notation Editor. And, of course, you
      can choose to examine just one Player's performance.<br>
      The Notation Window is simple and straightforward. You can view,
      and print out, the performance recorded by one, any or all
      Players. There are options for displaying transposing instruments
      (such as saxophones and trumpets) while retaining playback at the
      correct pitch, and for inputting text. A mini word‑processor lets
      you add titles, composer's notes and lyrics, with a choice of
      fonts, size, justification and type style; you don't have to worry
      about track names, since these are automatically derived from the
      Players in the current Ensemble.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Arrangement Window:</b> <br>
      It's here that you can create a song, one Section at a time. Of
      course, FreeStyle will let you record all your Players'
      performances in a linear fashion, but the use of Sections,
      especially in music of a pop nature, makes assembling the finished
      work that much easier, and quicker. A Section can be a 1‑bar drum
      loop, the verses and choruses of a song, or a complete symphonic
      movement scored for full orchestra — whatever suits your purposes.
      A pop‑up menu in the upper left of the Document Window provides a
      list of current Sections in a song, allowing you to easily move
      from one to another. In the Arrangement Window itself, these
      Sections are chained (or layered) to create the finished song. The
      Sections can be dragged from the list in the left of the window,
      and placed on the Arrangement grid. But Sections are also
      automatically assigned a letter (A to Z) or number (1 upwards),
      and simply pressing the corresponding key on your Mac keyboard
      places Sections automatically and sequentially on the grid.

      <b>Style Counsel</b><br>
      That, in a nutshell, is FreeStyle's front end. To start a new
      Song, you select an Ensemble, or create one from scratch, choose a
      Player (with no worries about program changes or bank select
      commands), choose a time signature and so on, hit the Record
      button and start recording.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to play to a metronome, you're not restricted to a
      beep: you can also use a riff (a library is supplied, and you can
      create your own too). A riff can be a drum pattern, a bassline, or
      anything you think you might be able to play along with; this riff
      can be made to 'become' a Player at a later stage if you'd really
      like it to be part of your song. Even if you choose not to use the
      metronome, it'll still click (if you want it to) during the
      pick‑up bar that cycles before you start recording.<br>
      <br>
      To record a part without the metronome, use FreeStyle's Sense
      Tempo function for best results (though you can record without it
      if you wish). This clever bit of programming tracks your
      performance, working out beats and bar locations as it goes. The
      result is a pretty much accurate representation of your
      performance in the Notation Window. FreeStyle manages this by
      generating a very precise tempo map as you play. And because the
      notes of your performance are lined up to beats and bars, features
      that depend on this alignment, such as quantisation, are
      available. It won't necessarily be that easy to start with: a
      Sense Tempo setting box is available to let you customise the
      software to the way you play. For example, FreeStyle needs to know
      how drastically your tempo might vary.<br>
      <br>
      Once you've finished your performance, especially if you've
      recorded a performance without Sense Tempo enabled, you might find
      that the score looks a bit odd. Now it's time to start cleaning it
      up. You can change time signatures or key signatures at any bar
      you like, so if your performance includes some bar lengths that
      deviate from the norm (say, the odd 5/4 or 6/4 bar in a 4/4
      piece), you can accommodate them. If this doesn't tidy up the
      screen, perhaps it's time to start thinking of using FreeStyle's
      Beat Adjustment features.<br>
      <br>
      The ability to play parts without the constraints of a metronome
      is a liberating experience.<br>
      Let's say you recorded a rubato performance without Sense Tempo,
      or have imported a MIDI file recorded, without reference to a
      metronome, on another sequencer. The notes of your performance
      aren't necessarily going to line up with the bar lines. The result
      of playing at around 80bpm, for example, while the sequencer is
      recording at 120bpm could look rather strange. Beat Adjustment
      lets you move beats or bar lines to the notes — sort of the
      opposite to quantisation, which normally moves sloppily played
      notes to the nearest beat. During the process of moving beats,
      FreeStyle generates a new tempo map, so that once you've got the
      notes lined up the way you want them, the performance still plays
      back in exactly the way it was recorded. Besides actually moving
      beats and bar lines, you have the option of tapping a new tempo
      along with a performance. The result is a tidy score with no
      compromise in the performance, and the performance can be
      quantised if you like.<br>

      <b>What's New In 2.01?</b><br>
      FreeStyle worked well when it was released a couple of years ago,
      but features have been continuously added and tweaks made, so that
      v2.01 has many extra bits that some people found lacking in
      earlier versions. For example, earlier versions of the software
      didn't allow you to change time or key signatures mid‑song; as
      mentioned earlier, this feature is now very much available, having
      been introduced in v2.0. Other new features include the Sense
      Tempo and Beat Adjustment features discussed earlier.<br>
      <br>
      Significant enhancements have been provided in the synchronisation
      department: the software now offers full SMPTE and MIDI TIme Code
      support, at all frame rates, so FreeStyle can sync, or be sync'ed
      to, just about anything. The ability to freely draw tempo changes
      (in the MIDI Controller section of the Graphic Editor window) is
      also new. Tempo maps can be imported from standard MIDI files, and
      you can also easily vary the overall tempo of a piece with even
      the most complicated tempo map. Use '% Variable', and a percentage
      offset is applied to the whole tempo map.<br>
      <br>
      A MIDI Monitor was introduced with v2.0; this allows you to keep
      track of MIDI In and Out activity and is a fair diagnostic tool
      for studios with lots of MIDI gear. Two nifty new editing
      functions are Tweak Notes and Choose Notes. The first lets you
      apply certain functions — fixing the length of, or adding a
      decrescendo to — a group of highlighted notes. Choose Notes allows
      you to be very specific about which notes you're going to edit,
      choosing a range of notes with a certain velocity value or
      duration, and quantising or transposing them.<br>

      <b>Free The Spirit</b><br>
      In use, FreeStyle couldn't be easier. From setting up your MIDI
      studio and recording your first rubato performance, to editing
      note data and arranging your final Song, this software is
      accessible and fun. There is little of the initial frustration
      that more sophisticated packages can cause. Newcomers will
      especially appreciate this, though they should keep the excellent
      manual to hand; the 'Picture Book Tour' chapter is essential
      reading.<br>
      <br>
      FreeStyle isn't direct competition for other sequencers, or the
      first step towards something better, but a totally different way
      of sequencing.<br>
      The use of Ensembles and Players, rather than tracks and patch
      changes, helps to bring the whole operation into perspective for
      the musical technophobe. The average MIDI sequencing session
      consists of too much time scrolling through sounds trying to find
      something that works. If, however, you spend a little time in
      advance with FreeStyle, defining Ensembles that suit your working
      style, you'll be able to start sequencing much more quickly on a
      new project. Similar templates could be set up in other sequencer
      packages, but how many of us actually do this?<br>
      <br>
      The only thing that might let FreeStyle down for some users is the
      lack of sophisticated editing, and perhaps the lack of an event
      editor. Cubase's Logical Edit, though rather cryptic, has a lot of
      fans, as do the groove‑based quantisation functions of many
      leading sequencing packages, and even MOTU's other software
      (Performer and Digital Performer) give you more control over raw
      MIDI data. However, in the same way that FreeStyle forces you to
      make choices with its Ensembles, so it forces you to fine‑tune
      your work with a limited, and more manageable, set of tools. I
      found that there was a way to accomplish most desired tasks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      It would be easy to think of FreeStyle as an entry‑level package,
      and the retail price of under £150 does seem to place it in the
      same market as Emagic's Logic Audio Discovery and Steinberg's
      Cubasis. But that would be to miss the point: FreeStyle isn't
      direct competition for other sequencers, or the first step towards
      something better, but a totally different way of sequencing.
      Certainly, its ease of use and the way it insulates the user from
      his or her computer makes FreeStyle ideal for the newcomer or
      MIDI‑phobe, but experienced — or jaded — MIDI and computer users
      will find something worthwhile here too. The ability to play parts
      without the constraints of a metronome, while the software tracks
      your tempo, is a liberating experience which FreeStyle handles
      brilliantly.<br>
      <br>
      And the actual experience of just sitting at your MIDI keyboard,
      playing in a relaxed manner, as if you were at a piano, and seeing
      a reasonable representation of your performance instantly
      appearing on your computer screen, is hard to describe: I think
      I've been waiting for this software since I started using
      sequencers!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Remote Control</b><br>
      Many sequencers have remote control options, but few go as far as
      FreeStyle in freeing the musician from his or her computer
      keyboard. All transport controls and recording features can be
      accessed from your MIDI keyboard. This is done by hitting a
      user‑definable clump of keys (to activate remote control mode),
      followed by some other key which has a function assigned to it. To
      make it easy to keep track of which functions are assigned to
      which keys, MOTU even supply a sheet of sticky labels for you to
      put on the keys used as remote controls.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>What's On The Menu?</b><br>
      The menu bar doesn't hide anything too extraordinary, but let's
      have a look.<br>
      <br>
      The File menu is self‑explanatory, with Save and Load options for
      files in FreeStyle and standard MIDI format; an 'Import to
      Section' option loads a MIDI file into a Section of a song, and
      when you're loading MIDI files a dialogue box opens that lets you
      map individual tracks to FreeStyle Players.<br>
      The Edit menu is also standard Mac fare: Cut, Copy, Paste, Clear,
      Select All and Undo are all here. The Preferences dialogue box
      lives in this menu, and apart from customising how FreeStyle boots
      up, it's here that you 'Lock Player Channels' if you want the
      program's dynamic MIDI channel assignment to be over‑ridden.<br>
      Under the Region menu, you'll find parameters such as Quantise,
      Transpose and Move, plus the more esoteric Choose Notes, Tweak
      Notes, and Identify Beats functions. Switch Staff moves
      highlighted notes from one staff to another in a two‑staff part
      (such as a piano), and Save As Metronome lets you turn any
      selected note data into a metronome riff. The last two Region
      items are Create and Override Playback Loop. A Playback Loop is a
      region of material that is looped until the end of a section; a
      1‑bar drum part, say, could be looped for an 8‑bar section, and
      Override lets you make changes to a measure within a Playback Loop
      without affecting the other repeats — for example, adding a few
      fills to the loop drum part I just mentioned.<br>
      The Record menu contains the Take management parameters (for
      naming, deleting, renaming Takes and so on), as well as those used
      for setting up Record Loops and working with the Sense Tempo
      functions which are so important to the accurate transcription of
      metronome‑free performances. On the Record Loop front, you can
      define a Record Loop before recording (two bars, eight bars or
      whatever), but if you use Auto Loop Record, FreeStyle will
      automatically loop to the beginning of a performance two bars
      after you've stopped playing.<br>
      The Song menu offers a similar set of management functions for
      Songs and Sections of Songs. It also includes change meter and key
      functions, and those for adjusting and recording beats.<br>
      Your studio setup (how the software interacts with your MIDI
      interface and attached equipment), PatchList library, Player and
      Ensemble Libraries are all managed under the Setup menu. This menu
      also features metronome, sync and remote control functions.<br>
      The Windows menu, not surprisingly, governs the appearance — or
      non‑appearance — of FreeStyle's Palettes and Windows, and offers
      plenty of control over how windows appear.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Pros</b><br>
      Musician‑friendly interface.<br>
      Trackless sequencing is fun sequencing!<br>
      Spookily accurate score transcription.<br>
      Good sync options.<br>
      <b><br>
        Cons</b><br>
      Editing might be a bit limited for some.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><br>
      There's nothing else quite like FreeStyle on the market. It feels
      like software designed by musicians, for musicians.<br>

      Article from The Mix, April 1995<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Interactive Mac sequencing</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      Not all musicians are the same, so why should they want to use the
      same sequencer. Ian Waugh finds a fresh approach to sequencing in
      Mark of the Unicorn's Freestyle for Mac.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_large.jpg"><img

      A typical Freestyle session with all the major windows open. All
      the Players have been selected in the Ensemble window and appear
      as different colours in the grid editor.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      There's a lot of activity in the budget-priced sequencer market.
      Not everyone can afford – or needs – one of the £300-400
      top-of-the-range jobbies, so it makes sense for sequencer
      developers to produce a budget range. Most such programs, however,
      are simply cut-down versions of their bigger brothers, so it's
      very interesting to see Mark of the Unicorn's FreeStyle.<br>
      <br>
      MOTU's premier program is Performer (reviewed in the February
      issue), and it was one of the very first professional sequencers
      to appear on the Mac. FreeStyle is nothing like it, although a few
      windows, albeit mostly hidden behind several options, have the
      distinctive Performer layout.<br>
      <br>
      No, FreeStyle is something completely different – a trackless
      sequencer. In fact, not only does it have no tracks, it lets you
      blissfully ignore such things as MIDI channels and program change
      numbers.<br>
      <br>
      Okay, so there is a small catch – there's a bit of setting up to
      do before you start using the program. However, the object of the
      exercise is not to hide these things from you completely, but to
      remove the distraction of tracks and MIDI channel assignments from
      the creative music-making process.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_2_large.jpg"><img

      The grid editor with the controller editor below. The chorus depth
      has been whacked up in this section.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Interrogation</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let's start at the beginning. When you first launch FreeStyle, you
      should have your MIDI interface installed, and your sound modules
      connected. FreeStyle interrogates the devices, so it knows what
      you're working with. It has a list of over 250 devices including
      samplers and effects units. If you have something different, it's
      fairly easy to add this to the list.<br>
      <br>
      Now that we've got that sorted out, let's make some music. Instead
      of tracks, patterns and MIDI channels, FreeStyle uses Ensembles,
      Players, Takes, Arrangements, Sections and Songs – terms all
      musicians will recognise. The first step is to select a suitable
      Ensemble. These are simply collections of sounds or Players, and
      there are 14 ready-made Ensembles to chose from, including Rock
      Band, String Quartet, Big Band, Synth Ensemble, Orchestra and Jazz
      Combo.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_3_large.jpg"><img
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          src="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_3_large.jpg"
          alt="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_3_large.jpg" width="636"
          border="0" height="204"></a><br>
      <br>
      You create your finished song in the Arrangement window by linking
      individual Sections together.<br>
      <br>
      The Players in the Rock Band, for example, consist of Horns,
      Guitar, Organ, Piano, Bass and Drums. Each Player has an
      associated sound selected from one of your MIDI devices. MIDI
      channels? Program numbers? The set up routine takes care of all
      that. You can, of course, create your own Ensembles, and add and
      remove Players from existing ones.<br>
      <br>
      You can select a different sound for any of the players from a pop
      up menu, which lists the instruments you have and the sounds they
      contain. It's dead easy. You can also adjust the volume and pan
      position, using neat graphic sliders.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_4_large.jpg"><img
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          src="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_4_large.jpg"
          alt="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_4_large.jpg" width="567"
          border="0" height="329"></a><br>
      <br>
      Adjust the volume and pan settings of the Players in the Ensemble
      window using cute sliders.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Sectioned off</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now that you have your band, the next step is to record some
      music. FreeStyle likes you to work in sections, but you don't have
      to, at least not all the time. A section will typically be an
      intro, verse or chorus, although it could be something as short as
      a one-bar arpeggio, or as long as the complete song.<br>
      <br>
      As soon as you've selected your Ensemble, you're ready to record a
      section. The main screen you work with is the edit screen, and you
      can flip between a grid editor and a score editor. Each Player
      appears in the grid editor as a different colour, and has its own
      stave in the score editor. If the grid editor gets too busy – as
      it can do when several players are active – you can hide certain
      ones.<br>
      <br>
      Let's say you want to record a four-bar intro. Set a four bar
      section to loop, and click on record. Click, click, click, goes
      the metronome. Well, it can, but even here FreeStyle is trying to
      bring out the creativity in you. Instead of a click you can use
      drum riffs. There are over 30 to choose from, and you can easily
      create your own.<br>
      <br>
      This is such a good idea, it really helps you get into the mood of
      the music you are writing. I know several people who record a drum
      track, which they can follow during recording for just that
      reason.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_5_large.jpg"><img
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          src="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_5_large.jpg"
          alt="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_5_large.jpg" width="636"
          border="0" height="413"></a><br>
      <br>
      The remote control settings let you control many of Freestyle's
      functions from the comfort of your own MIDI keyboard.<br>
      <br>
      You can tell FreeStyle to wait for the first note before starting
      recording, in which case it will loop around the first bar until
      you hit a key. However, if you play just before the first bar, the
      program will recognise this as a pick up and put it into the
      music. The Smooth Record Loop option will play pick up notes
      occurring before the loop, just before the loop repeats, so the
      music is not interrupted. Really neat.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Take five</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      Select one of the Players and record a Take. If you are in loop
      mode, the Section will loop when you've finished. But, as may
      often be the case, what happens if you're not quite happy with the
      recording? Select another track or pattern, assign it to a MIDI
      channel and program number? Not with FreeStyle. You simply record
      another take: As many as you like. It remembers them all, and you
      can select the best later on. Select the other Players and record
      in similar fashion, until the Section is complete. That's the
      intro, now for the verse.<br>
      <br>
      We need another Section for this, so select one from the Song
      menu, name it, and you can start recording again. The editors only
      show one section at a time. And so you carry on recording chorus,
      middle eight, solo and end Sections.<br>
      <br>
      Next stop is the Arrangement window, where you link them together.
      The Sections you've created appear in a list on the left. To put
      them in the song, you just drag them over to the grid on the
      right.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_6_large.jpg"><img
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          src="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_6_large.jpg"
          alt="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_6_large.jpg" width="601"
          border="0" height="383"></a><br>
      <br>
      The Ensemble Library lets you create new Ensembles and add and
      remove Players.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, it is a little like pattern-based recording, but each section
      is a self-contained entity containing all the players used in that
      piece of the music, rather than simply holding individual music
      lines. A pattern-based system may be more flexible, but this is
      certainly easier.<br>
      <br>
      If you've used a pattern-based sequencer, you will be aware of the
      problem of pick up notes. It's usually easiest to work with
      complete bars rather than parts of a bar, and it can be a bit of a
      job getting pick up notes to play in the correct place. Each
      section in FreeStyle has a pick up and an overlap bar, which
      enables you to line up the sections to the nearest bar, while
      ensuring that the tops and tails still play.<br>
      <br>
      What happens if you want to record a music line which runs across
      two or more sections? No problem. Select the Follow Song function,
      and you can record into several sections as the music plays.<br>
      <br>
      <h2><br>
        Friendly</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      In its efforts to be as musician-friendly as possible, FreeStyle
      lets you control virtually all of the recording functions from
      your MIDI keyboard. You press down a cluster of three keys – this
      will usually be quite safe unless you're recording Stockhausen –
      and then another key. So during your bout of musical creativity,
      you don't even have to touch the computer.<br>
      <br>
      The program has several edit features, including Quantisation.
      There is no partial quantise function, but there is a swing
      setting which gives a shuffle feel to a recording.<br>
      <br>
      You can edit notes in the grid and score editors, by clicking and
      dragging with the mouse. You can also insert notes in step time
      using the Brush tool, selecting note durations from a pop up menu.
      The controller editor (below the grid editor), shows controller
      data as vertical bars. Here you can edit note velocities, draw in
      volume curves and so on.<br>
      <br>
      Text can also be added to the notation in the Score Editor, but
      there are no music symbols. You can print the score complete, and
      print out individual parts. If one of the Players is a transposing
      instrument, the program will automatically select the correct
      stave for it. Nice.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_7_large.jpg"><img
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          src="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_7_large.jpg"
          alt="./MX_95_04_motu_freesty_7_large.jpg" width="616"
          border="0" height="417"></a><br>
      <br>
      The FreeMIDI application helps you set up your studio information,
      no matter how complex.<br>
      <br>
      But there are a few omissions. For example, there's no event
      editor. You may not need it very often, but it's useful to be able
      to get in there among the bits and bytes of MIDI data on occasion.
      The program doesn't directly support Sys Ex messages either, which
      could limit the more advanced musician.<br>
      <br>
      It can load Standard MIDI Files, but only Format 1, in which each
      MIDI channel is on a different track. Some third-party MIDI file
      companies only supply Format 0 files, relying on a sequencer's
      ability to split the track by MIDI channel, if the user wants to
      edit the data.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps even more irritating is the fact that the program will
      ignore a program change in the middle of a track, and all tempo
      instructions apart from the first one. I find it very hard to
      understand how MOTU can justify this. It's not only classical
      music which has tempo changes. Perhaps an update will fix it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Verdict</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Where the program does get full marks is in musician-friendliness.
      The manual is excellent, and is even printed in colour. Yes,
      presentation does make a difference. I can't recall any other
      sequencer manual in colour, although I'm sure someone will let us
      know if there is one. You also get a one-hour tutorial video, and
      this really is excellent, too.<br>
      <br>
      Bearing in mind its limitations – and I'm sure they won't worry a
      lot of potential buyers – FreeStyle suits the newcomer to
      sequencing, and even the more experienced musician who has never
      been happy with the computer approach to sequencing. It's probably
      as musician-friendly as a sequencer can get, and well worth
      exploring if you don't want or need one of the big boys. Full
      marks to MOTU for innovation.<br>

      What you need<br>
      FreeStyle will run on a Classic II, Colour Classic or higher Mac,
      and it is compatible with PowerBooks other than the 100.<br>
      <br>
      You'll need at least 5Mb of RAM, and System 7.0.1 or later. It
      runs quite happily with System 7.5 — and so it should. A colour
      monitor is recommended, but the program is not highly
      window-oriented, so a large monitor is not essential.<br>
