From: [https://github.com/gwald/MOTU-FreeStyle-Helper](https://github.com/gwald/MOTU-FreeStyle-Helper)
 
 [Download](https://github.com/gwald/MOTU-FreeStyle-Helper/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract all files into where your FreeStyle.exe is on your drive and run FS_Helper/build_deploy.bat before using.

 
This is a AutoHotKey v1.1 script to improve the user interface of FreeStyle, mostly mouse driven.
* When starting FS_Helper.exe it will also launch FS and when FS is closed it will self terminate.
* F1 launches the index.html single help file (anyone can contribute to it) in the FreeStyle_extended_help folder if it's not found, it will try to launch the PDF version FreeStyle_extended_help.pdf, lastly if not found it will launch the normal windows help file, FreeStyle.hlp .
* Shift F1 launches the FreeStyle v1 (Mac) Manual PDF.
* Mouse interface only tested in Graphic (grid) view, with a single .FSL project open:
*  * Scroll wheel moves the page forward and backwards (no shortcut available!).
* * Right mouse button with scroll wheel moves the page up and down (no shortcut available!).
* * Middle mouse button with scroll wheel zooms in (F9) and out (Shift F9).
* * Left mouse button with middle mouse button resets the view (F11), stops playing (ESC) and applies the "Tile Pallet Left" window setting.
* * Left mouse button with Right mouse button toggles note select and paint features, doing it twice launches the Brush/Cursor Settings window.
