Mark of the Unicorn - FreeStyle midi sequencer helper stuff

	FS_Helper
 
	From: https://github.com/gwald/MOTU-FreeStyle-Helper

 
	This is a AutoHotKey v1.1 script to improve the user interface of FreeStyle, mostly mouse driven.
 
 * When starting FS_Helper.exe it will also lauch FS and when FS is closed it will self terminate.
 * F1 launches the HTML single help file (anyone can contribute to it) if it's not found it will launch the normal windows help file.
 * Mouse interface (only works in Graphic/grid view):
 *  *  Scroll wheel moves the page forward and backs (no short cuts available!).
 *  *  Right mouse button with scroll wheel moves the page up and down (no short cuts available!).
 *  *  Middle mouse button with scroll wheel zooms in (F9) and out (Shift F9).
 *  *  Left mouse button with middle mouse button resets the view (F11), stops playing (ESC) and applies the Tiles Pallet Left window setting.
 *  *  Lef mouse button with Right mouse button toggles note select and paint features, doing it twice launches the Brush/Cursor Settings window.
