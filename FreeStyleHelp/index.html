	<H2>NOTE AND TIPS: </H2>
	<BR> * FreeStyle only has one single level of undo and redo, which was common with early sequencers. 
	<BR> * Using scrubbing over many notes can cause crashes.

	This is a AutoHotKey v1.1 script to improve the user interface of FreeStyle, mostly mouse driven.
	<BR> * When starting FS_Helper.exe it will also lauch FS and when FS is closed it will self terminate.
	<BR> * F1 launches the HTML single help file (anyone can contribute to it) if it's not found it will launch the normal windows help file.
	<BR> * Mouse interface (only works in Graphic/grid view):
	<br> * * *  Scroll wheel moves the page forward and backs (no short cuts available!).
	<br> * * *  Right mouse button with scroll wheel moves the page up and down (no short cuts available!).
	<BR> * * *  Middle mouse button with scroll wheel zooms in (F9) and out (Shift F9).
	<BR> * * *  Left mouse button with middle mouse button resets the view (F11), stops playing (ESC) and applies the Tiles Pallet Left window setting.
	<BR> * * *  Lef mouse button with Right mouse button toggles note select and paint features, doing it twice launches the Brush/Cursor Settings window.

</font><font size="2">Welcome to FreeStyle! This Quick-Start guide will help you get started as quickly as possible.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Check These Things First</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Before you run FreeStyle for the first time, review the following checklist.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have you installed a Windows MIDI driver in your computer's system?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You must install at least one MIDI driver to run FreeStyle. Even if you just want to explore FreeStyle and don't intend to record or play back any music, a MIDI driver must still be present. For more information, see <u>Installing A MIDI Driver</u></font>.<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you want FreeStyle to play music, do you have a MIDI playback device connected to (or installed in) the computer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FreeStyle requires MIDI-equipped hardware to record and play back music. For playback, you can use a MIDI-equipped sound card or an external keyboard synthesizer or sound module. For more information, see <u>Setting Up MIDI Playback</u><br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you want to record your own music into FreeStyle, do you have a MIDI keyboard or other controller connected to the computer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For more information, see <u>Connecting a MIDI Controller</u>.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Once you've completed the checklist, use the browse button (&gt;&gt;) at the top of this help window to continue with this Quick-Start Guide.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">Before you proceed further, click the manufacturer of your MIDI playback device below. These help topics, listed by manufacturer, tell you how to make crucial settings in your MIDI instrument that allow FreeStyle to initialize the instrument. Doing so lets you access the device's sounds as easily as possible from within FreeStyle. It is best to do this before you launch FreeStyle for the first time.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>If you have a sound card, you can skip this step.</b></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">If your MIDI device is not listed, read the section called "General advice about setting up your MIDI device". It will help you figure out how to best set up your instrument for use with FreeStyle.<br>

After reading the "Welcome to FreeStyle" window, click OK to proceed to the Studio Setup window shown below, which lets you tell FreeStyle about your MIDI gear.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">If you have a MIDI-equipped sound card in your computer, it should appear in this window, and no further settings should be necessary for the card. The same goes for MIDI instruments that you might have connected directly to the computer (via a serial cable instead of a MIDI interface). If you have MIDI devices connected to a MIDI interface, you'll see a generic General MIDI device in the window as shown below. Replace the Generic device with your MIDI device by choosing it by name from the drop-down list.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Installing A MIDI Driver <u><img data="bm2.jpg" title="bm2.jpg"></u></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Installing a MIDI Driver</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A MIDI driver is software that you install into Windows that allows FreeStyle to communicate with your MIDI device(s) for playback and recording. A Windows-compatible MIDI driver should have been included on a disk with your MIDI-equipped sound card, MIDI interface, or MIDI instrument(if it has a built-in MIDI interface). If you do not have a Windows driver for your device, contact the manufacturer.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">&gt;&gt; If you don't yet have a MIDI driver installed, you must install it before running FreeStyle. FreeStyle requires you to install at least one MIDI driver.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Follow the appropriate procedure below to install or update your MIDI driver(s) in Windows 95, 98, NT, or 2000.<br>
</font>If you need to add a MIDI device to your computer, first turn off your computer and physically install or connect your MIDI device (multi-port interface, sound card, etc.). Be sure to check the device documentation for the proper physical installation procedure. Once the device has been installed or attached, turn your computer back on.<br>
IMPORTANT: After the driver has been installed and configured, you will be prompted to restart Windows. You must restart Windows for the new driver to take effect. When Windows restarts, your MIDI device should be ready to use.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">&gt;&gt; NOTE: If the Wizard didn't list your MIDI device and you don't have a CD or diskette for it, or for technical support on loading and configuring the device's driver, you should contact the device manufacturer, NOT Mark of the Unicorn, Inc. or Microsoft Corporation.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">How to install or update a MIDI driver in Windows 95 or 98</font></b><br>
<font size="2">If the new device is Plug &amp; Play, Windows should either automatically load the device's driver files or prompt you to provide them (probably by inserting a floppy diskette or CD included with the device). Windows 95/98 should be able to load and configure the appropriate driver for the device automatically. If this is the case, you can stop reading this file right now since the Windows 95/98 Plug &amp; Play system will take care of everything automatically.<br>
</font>If the new device is not Plug &amp; Play, you will have to load and configure the driver yourself. To do so, open Control Panel and double-click the &quot;Add New Hardware&quot; icon. In general, follow the Add New Hardware wizard's on-screen instructions.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">[ WINDOWS 98 ONLY: ]<br>
[ You will see a dialog that says, &quot;Windows will now search for any new Plug and Play devices on your system. ... To continue, click Next.&quot; You must click Next and wait a few seconds, even if you know that your device will not be found. Next you will see a dialog that says, &quot;Is the device that you want to install listed below?&quot; Select the &quot;No&quot; radio button and click the &quot;Next&quot; button. Next you will see a dialog that says, &quot;Windows can now search for hardware that is not Plug and Play compatible, or you can select your hardware from a list. ... Do you want Windows to search for your new hardware?&quot; Select the &quot;No&quot; radio button and click the &quot;Next&quot; button. ]<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">IMPORTANT: When the Wizard asks...<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Do you want Windows to search for your new hardware?&quot;<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">...select &quot;No&quot;. This will allow you to specify the MIDI device yourself. Selecting &quot;Yes&quot; to allow Windows to search for non-Plug &amp; Play MIDI devices MAY NOT WORK. If you know what kind of device you want to add, you are better off selecting &quot;No&quot; and then manually specifying the device, as described below.<br>
</font>After selecting &quot;No&quot; and clicking &quot;Next&quot;, the next step in the Wizard is to specify a hardware type. From the Wizard's &quot;Hardware types&quot; list, scroll-down and choose...<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Sound, video and game controllers&quot;<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">This type encompasses MIDI devices. Click &quot;Next&quot; and then determine if your MIDI device appears in the Wizard's list. If it does, select your device from the list, click &quot;Next&quot; and skip the following paragraph.<br>
</font>If the Wizard did NOT list your device, but you DO have a CD or diskette for the device, insert the CD or diskette into your computer and click the special &quot;Have disk...&quot; button to the right. In the resulting &quot;Install From Disk&quot; dialog, specify the drive letter of your floppy or CD drive, followed by a colon and a backslash, and then click &quot;OK&quot;. A list will appear containing one or more entries. Choose the entry appropriate for your MIDI device and click &quot;OK&quot;.<br>
Continue to follow the Wizard's instructions. When it finishes, a configuration dialog for your MIDI device may appear. At this point, you should consult your device's documentation for how to properly configure it using the dialog.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">&gt;&gt; IMPORTANT: After the driver has been installed and configured, you must restart Windows for the new driver to take effect.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">How to install or update a MIDI driver in Windows 2000</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Open Control Panel and double-click the &quot;Add/Remove Hardware&quot; icon. Follow the directions given by the Add/Remove Hardware wizard. When asked to &quot;Select the hardware task you want to perform,&quot; click on the&quot;Add/Troubleshoot a device&quot; radio button, then click the &quot;Next&quot; button. Windows 2000 will then search for Plug &amp; Play devices. If the new device is Plug &amp; Play, Windows 2000 should either automatically load the device's driver files or prompt you to provide them (probably by inserting a floppy diskette or CD included with the device). Windows 2000 should be able to load and configure the appropriate driver for the device automatically. If this is the case, you can stop reading this file right now since the Windows 2000 Plug &amp; Play system will take care of everything automatically.<br>
</font>If the new device is not Plug &amp; Play, you will have to load and configure the driver yourself. In the next window, select &quot;Add a new device&quot; from the Devices list and then click on the &quot;Next&quot; button. When asked if you want Windows to search for your new hardware, select &quot;No, I want to select the hardware from a list&quot; and click on Next. Scroll down the list of hardware types and select &quot;Sound, video and game controllers,&quot; then click on Next.<br>
In the next window, you are presented with a list of Manufacturers and Models for devices that Windows 2000 knows about. If your device is in the lists, choose the correct manufacturer and model and then click on Next. Otherwise, if you have a CD or floppy that came with your device, click on &quot;Have Disk.&quot; In the resulting &quot;Install From Disk&quot; dialog, specify the drive letter of your floppy or CD drive, followed by a colon and a backslash, and then click &quot;OK&quot;. A list will appear containing one or more entries. Choose the entry appropriate for your MIDI device and click &quot;Next&quot;. Windows may inform you that it is using &quot;default settings to install the software for this hardware device.&quot; If so, click Next again. Windows may also inform you that &quot;The software you are about to install does not contain a Microsoft digital signature.&quot; Click &quot;Yes&quot; to continue the installation. If the&quot;Files Needed&quot; dialog appears, use the &quot;Browse&quot; button to select the mentioned file on your floppy or CD, and then click &quot;OK.&quot; <br>
Continue to follow the Wizard's instructions. When it finishes, a configuration dialog for your MIDI device may appear. At this point, you should consult your device's documentation for how to properly configure it using the dialog.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Control Palette provides buttons that look just like the controls on a CD Player or tape deck: play, stop, pause, rewind, and record. Use these buttons to get around in your music. They operate just like a standard tape deck, except that things happen instantly because you don't have to wait for tape to rewind.<br>
</font>The counter shows the current playback location in the music. The location is displayed in measures, beats, and ticks (there are 960 ticks per quarter note) or in minutes, seconds, and tenths of a second.<br>
The tempo slider lets you change the tempo of your music at any time. Unlike a tape deck or CD player, however, changing the tempo of your music won't affect its pitch. The Tempo Mode menu lets you play your music at a constant tempo or a variable, changing tempo as determined by a tempo map that you have created. The Record Mode menu lets you record to a click or freely without one.<br>
Tempo is displayed in beats per minute (bpm). Drag the tempo slider to change the tempo, or type in a tempo. In the Variable tempo mode, the slider is usable only while recording. In the Constant or % Variable tempo modes, it adjusts the overall tempo of your song.<br>

</font><font size="2">FreeStyle provides two intuitive environments in which to view and edit your music: the graphic editing and notation views. These views are where you'll do the majority of your work in FreeStyle. Both views exist in the same window, and you toggle between them using the buttons shown below. Think of them as two windows through which you view the same music.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm69.jpg" title="bm69.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Both views can show any combination of players at any time. Just highlight the player names you want to see in the Ensemble palette. In the Graphic Editing view, each player is shown in a unique color or pattern (depending on the setting in the Preferences command). In the notation view, each player gets its own staff or grand staff.<br>
</font>Both views can display any section or song in the document. Just choose the desired section or song from the pop-up menu at the top of the window. When you view a song, you see all of its sections together at once. The boundaries between sections are indicated by heavy vertical lines in the note grid.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Dynamic transcription</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The notation display is dynamic: you can fully edit the music using the same conventions as graphic editing. Changes in either view are immediately reflected in the other. When you record, the staves immediately fill up with the notes you play as you record. Unlike other simplistic music software programs, FreeStyle's notation transcription is a sophisticated interpretation of the raw MIDI data you record. For example, if you play swing, turn on the Straighten Swing feature in the Setup menu (under the Notation menu item) and FreeStyle writes it using straight rhythms instead of triplets.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">What you see is what you get</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle's notation view is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) page view: what you see on the screen is exactly what you will get when you print. Music is automatically placed on as many pages as are necessary. FreeStyle manages the note spacing, measures widths, and staff spacing so that musical symbols never collide.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Automatic instrument part transposition</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When you display one player by itself, FreeStyle automatically transposes the part according to standard practice for the instrument. For example, alto sax players are transposed to Eb. The Edit Player Info command in the Setup menu lets you choose how an individual player is transposed, as well as the amount of space needed between its staff and neighboring staves.<br>
</font>When you display more than one player at a time in the Notation view (a score), FreeStyle is configured &quot;out of the box&quot; to use concert pitch for all players. But you can change any player's score transposition to be anything you want. To do so, click the player in the Ensemble palette to select it and choose Edit Player Info from the Setup menu. Then set the Score transposition as desired. Most commonly, you'll either leave it set to concert pitch (C natural) or you'll make it identical to the player's part transposition. This is also a good place to transpose by octave parts that tend to be displayed too many ledger lines above or below the staff, such as a bass part that your MIDI instrument plays an octave lower than you would like it to be notated.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">&quot;Under the hood&quot;, when you record music into FreeStyle, the program actually records MIDI data from your MIDI instrument. When you play a note, press the sustain pedal, or move your pitch bend wheel, your MIDI keyboard sends a stream of numerical MIDI data representing your performance to FreeStyle, which faithfully records it. Most of the time, FreeStyle frees you from this level of technical detail so you can focus on your music. However there may be times when it would help you to see the MIDI data in its raw, numerical form. The Event List window does just that, giving you precise control over your music.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Event list basics</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">To open the Event List Window, choose Event List from the Window menu. Similar to the Graphic Editing and Notation windows, the Event List window displays the notes (and other data) for all of the players that are currently highlighted in the Ensemble palette. You can look at an individual player (by clicking the player's name in the palette) or several players together. Each MIDI event is displayed in the list as a single line of information, starting on the left-hand side with the player it belongs to.<br>
</font>Just above the scrolling list of MIDI data is a Show menu, which lets you control what types of data FreeStyle will display in the list. If you click the Show Step Controls button, the top portion of the window expands to display FreeStyle's step recording controls (described in the next section).<br>
To the left of the scrolling list of MIDI data is the wiper bar, which contains FreeStyle's familiar scrolling playback wiper. Click anywhere in the bar to advance playback to that location. As usual, you can scrub the music by grabbing the handle of the wiper and dragging it up or down - but remember, the Silent Scrubbing preference (in the Edit menu) must be unchecked for notes to sound as you scrub.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">The controls in the panel at the top of the Event List window let you insert notes and any other type of MIDI events. To get ready for inserting, record-enable the player you want to insert events for. If you will be entering notes from your MIDI keyboard, make sure that the record button is pressed in the Control Palette. (This is required for MIDI keyboard entry.) Then use the controls at the top of the window to choose the type of event you want to insert. Move the playback wiper to where you want to insert the event, and then click the Insert button or press the Enter key. For more details about this process, see &quot;Step Recording&quot;.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Editing MIDI data parameters</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The event list shows 'parameters' - detailed characteristics - of each event in the list. For example, FreeStyle shows the velocity (vel) of each note, which is a number between zero and 127 that represents how hard the note was struck when you played it. To edit any parameter, just double-click the number and type in the desired value. Press the return key to confirm your edit, or use the arrow keys to confirm your edit and move to adjacent parameters in the list. Use the Enter key to confirm the edit and move to the next event.<br>
</font>Each column gives you details about each MIDI event. &quot;ST&quot; stands for Step Time, which refers to the length of time until the next event. The ST value lets you easily see and edit how far apart events are from one another. &quot;Dur&quot; stands for Duration, which refers to the duration of notes. For types of data that don't have duration, like a volume controller event, the Duration column shows other information, such as the volume level.<br>
Note: ST values can't be edited when you are viewing a song.<br>
The note icons displayed to the right of the pitch on some notes do NOT represent the note's duration. Instead, they represent the note's approximate Step Time duration (the amount of time until the next event).<br>
Use the up/down arrow keys to select events from the computer keyboard.<br>
Use the left/right and up/down arrow keys to edit data.<br>
If a note appears grayed, it means that the note is actually a pick-up note generated by FreeStyle with the <u>Smooth Record Loop option</u> turned on. On black and white monitors, the note is displayed in italics.<br>
If a note appears in italics, it means that the note is actually a playback loop note generated by FreeStyle. Click <u>here</u> for details about playback loops.<font size="3"><br>

	<b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Event List <font size="1"> (5 of 8)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Editing the ST (step time) values</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The ST value of an event is its Step Time, which is the distance between it and the next event in the list. Changing the ST value is different than changing the other parameters of the event because the ST value affects all of the events that follow it in the event list.<br>
</font>Here's an example: let's say that you change the ST of an event from 480 to 960. In doing so, you've just moved later by 480 ticks all of the events after it that are currently being displayed in the event list. So you've actually performed a Move operation, just as if you had used the Move command in the Region menu. Further, the event whose ST time you changed hasn't moved at all, since the ST time affects only what comes after the event. As you can see, it is important to make note of which players you are showing in the Event List before editing ST values (as indicated by which ones are highlighted in the Ensemble palette). Be sure to keep these things in mind when you are editing ST values.<br>
And here's another thing to keep in mind: ST edits are subject to the same restrictions as the Move command (since they are essentially the exact same type of edit operation). For example, you cannot move events past the end of a section. These same rules apply when editing ST values: you cannot edit an ST time such that any subsequent events are shifted past the end of the section. In addition, FreeStyle will not allow you to edit ST values when you are viewing a song in the Event List. You have to change to a section in order to do so.<font size="3"><br>

Once an event is selected, you can apply FreeStyle's Edit menu and Region menu commands to it, such as Cut, Copy, Transpose, Quantize, etc. To select several consecutive events, drag over them. To select multiple events that are not next to each other, shift-click them.<font size="3"><br>

The check marks are &quot;sticky&quot;, so you can check more than one thing at a time. This comes in very handy. For example, let' saddfagvbxcs say that you would like to delete all controllers quickly. Just check All Controllers in the menu (make sure that nothing else is checked), select all, and press the delete key.<br>

</font><font size="2">Players in the Ensemble Palette act much like musicians: they play a certain instrument, and they can record multiple takes for each section of music. They only play one take at a time, but they remember every take you record, so you can play any take you want at any time. Just select it from the take pop-up menu. Each player has settings for volume, left/right panning, and more.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">Players in the Ensemble window represent much more than just a sound on your MIDI instrument. They also have many settings that control the way they are presented throughout the program. For example, the Player Info window has several options that control how the player is formatted when displayed in the Notation view.<br>
</font>Choose a sound from one of your MIDI instruments from the Sound menu.<br>
The transpose recording option transposes your controller when you are recording the player. It helps with players whose note range falls outside the range of the keys on your controller, such as a bass player. This also allows you to read a Bb trumpet part, for example, and record it in Bb while the rest of the ensemble is playing in concert.<br>
The player abbreviation appears in the notation display to the left of each staff (except the first one) when more than two players are being displayed.<br>
The 'Save in Player library' button replaces the existing player library entry with the current settings.If you want to lock a player's sound to a specific MIDI channel, use the 'Channel' menu. <br>
If you want FreeStyle to dynamically choose a MIDI channel for you based on its built-in knowledge about your MIDI instrument, select 'Auto.'.<br>
The clef and staff spacing options determine the clef and spacing between the staves when the player is displayed in the notation view.<br>
The transpose options control how the player is transposed when it is displayed as a part (by itself in the notation view) or in a score (with other players).<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">A take is a place to record a single player's part in a specific section of music. The current take for each player is displayed next to the player in the Ensemble window. Recording always takes place into the current take (for the currently record-enabled player), even if there is already music in the take. FreeStyle never erases existing music when recording new music. Each player can record an unlimited number of takes. Each player has a different set of takes for each section of music (Intro, Chorus, Verse, etc.) To view takes for a section, choose the section from the pop-up menu in the Graphic Editing/Notation window.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">Sections are the basic building blocks of music in FreeStyle. A section is a place to store music. It can be anything, from a 2-bar drum loop to a 300-bar orchestral movement. It consists of a "pickup" measure, a start, an end, and an "overhang" measure. Most importantly, each section has its own set of takes for each player. For example, take 1 for the Piano player in the Intro section is different from the Piano player's take 1 in the Verse. Only one take is active for each player at any time in a section. But different players can play different takes. For example, the piano player might be playing take 3 in the Verse, while the bass player is playing take 6.<br>
</font>Sections also have their own tempo maps, which are displayed in the Tempo Source menu at the top of the Ensemble palette.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">Sections can be of any length. They are initially given a length of four bars, but if you record past the end of a section, it will grow to accommodate the notes you play in. If the section has been placed in a song and it butts up against another section, FreeStyle won't automatically grow the section any more.<br>
</font>To adjust the length of a section, drag the heavy, black double-lined vertical end bar displayed in the Graphic Editing window in the note grid. You can also adjust its length anywhere it appears in the Arrangement window grid: just grab the right edge of the section and drag it.<font size="3"><br>

A red bar appears on the currently record-enabled section in the Arrangement grid.<br>
</font>When using sections in FreeStyle, you can think in terms of "patterns" (like verse, chorus, bridge, etc.), but you don't have to. You can also use sections in a linear fashion. FreeStyle even lets you go back and forth between thinking linearly and thinking in terms of patterns.<font size="3"><br>

The pickup and overhang measures are part of the section: they go with the section wherever the section goes. But the best part is that they don't get in the way. For example, when you work with sections in a song, a four bar section is still a four bar section, even if it has a few pickup notes.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Building a song in the Arrangement window</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">To add sections to the song, drag them from the Section list on left into the grid on the right. You can add the same section as many times as you want. For example, the chorus section may appear four times in your song. So just drag it from the Section list into the grid four times and place the four copies where they should go. The four copies are called &quot;instances&quot; of the original section. If you change the original, they all change, too. This doesn't have to be the case, though. If you want to make a copy that is different, use the Duplicate Section command to make a copy of the original, and then modify the duplicate section.<br>
</font>You can freely drag sections around in the Arrangement grid. Place sections in any row you wish; sections placed above or below one another play at the same time. If you place a section between two other back-to-back sections, FreeStyle automatically moves them to squeeze in the new section. Sections in the same row cannot overlap. To overlap them, place them in different rows.<br>
If one of your sections has tempo, meter or key changes in it (see the index for further information on these topics), and you would like your song to follow them, put the section in the top row of the Arrangement grid (called the &quot;song structure row&quot;). All other sections placed below it in the grid will follow it, too.<font size="3"><br>

Just choose the song from the pop-up menu in the upper left-hand corner of the window. The only difference is that in a song, you see all of its sections at once. Remember, sections in the top row of the Arrangement window grid appear by name in the time line, and their boundaries are indicated in the note grid by heavy vertical lines. In the Notation view, their names appear above each staff system. While viewing a song, you can rename it or get rid of it using the commands in the Song menu.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">The current section or song is the one you are listening to, viewing, and recording into in the Arrangement and Graphic Editing/Notation windows. Most of the commands in the Song menu affect the current section or song. If you are currently viewing a song, then there is also a &quot;record-enabled section&quot; within that song. If you are currently viewing a single section, then that section is also the record-enabled section.

&quot;Section:&quot; popup menu in the Ensemble Palette -- this popup menu is active only when you are viewing a song.

<b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Showing and hiding players<font size="1"> (1 of 1)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">As you work with either the Notation or Graphic Editing views, you'll constantly be changing what players you are viewing at any given time. For example, you may want to view a single player by itself, without the clutter of other instruments getting in the way.<br>
</font>Use the Ensemble window to control whether players are visible or hidden using the techniques below:<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To view a single player alone (and hide all other players): click the player's name.<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To turn a single player on or off without changing the others: shift-click the player's name or click the colored tab in the "Show" column next to its name (or its record button).<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To view a certain set of players: click the name of the first player and then shift-click the others.<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To view all players: shift-click the name of all players that are currently hidden.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">When changing the status of more than one player (making three more players visible for example), it is faster to do so in the Graphic Editing view than the Notation view. Try switching to Graphic Editing first and switch back to notation when you are done.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Creating tempo maps</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">A tempo map consists of a series of changing tempos. The tempo changes can be sudden, from one constant tempo to another (such as an immediate change from 102 beats per minute to 136 bpm). Or they can consist of a series of continuously changing tempos over time. You can even create rubato tempo maps that change as often and freely as you like. FreeStyle lets you create, modify and play back as many different tempo maps as you like for your song, and you can freely switch between them at any time.<br>
</font>There are several ways to create a tempo map in FreeStyle:<br>
1. Draw tempo changes with the pencil tool (and other drawing tools) in FreeStyle's Graphic Editing view.<br>
2. Record FreeStyle's tempo slider during playback.<br>
3. Import a MIDI file that contains a tempo map.<br>
4. Record a tempo map that you play into FreeStyle using FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature.<br>
5. Use one of FreeStyle's beat adjustment features (Identify Beats, Record Beats, or Adjust Beats), which generate a tempo map during the process of making FreeStyle's beats and bar lines match a MIDI performance that was recorded without a metronome.<br>
These methods are discussed in the following sections. Once you create a tempo map, you can make your music follow it by choosing either the Variable or % Variable tempo mode in the Control Palette.<font size="3"><br>
<p><hr><p>
	
	
	
</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Tempo<font size="1"> (4 of 12)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Drawing tempo maps in the Graphic Editor</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">With the Graphic Editing view visible, choose Controllers from the View menu, and then choose Tempo from the Type menu below the controllers editor view. You may then use the drawing tools to draw in tempos. When you manually make a change to the tempo map in this way, your music will play slower or faster according to the tempos you enter.<br>
</font>To enter a constant tempo over a region, select the area with the I-beam tool and type a tempo into the tempo field below the graph. If you would like to express the tempo with a duration other than a quarter note, use the note button provided next to the beat per minute value. When you press return to enter the constant tempo, it will take effect over the entire selected area. To enter a constant tempo for the entire section (or song), select any portion of tempos (the exact selection doesn't matter) and then choose Select All from the Edit menu to select the entire tempo map. (If you don't select some tempos with the I-beam tool before choosing Select All, it will select notes instead of tempo controllers.)<br>
To hear the results of the changes you make to the tempo map, set the tempo mode pop-up menu in the Control Palette to Variable or % Variable before you start playback.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">When FreeStyle is operating in variable tempo mode, the tempo slider is recordable. Just set the tempo mode pop-up menu in the Control Palette to Variable, click on the record button and the play button, then drag the slider as your music plays. Tempo events will be generated and recorded into the current section or song's tempo map. To see this happen, display the tempo map as shown below. After you drag the tempo slider and let go of the mouse button, you will see a graph of the tempo events that you recorded.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Tempo mode settings</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle provides three different tempo modes, which can be selected from the Tempo pop-up in the Control Palette.<br>
</font><img data="bm180.jpg" title="bm180.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Constant</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When set to Constant tempo mode, FreeStyle plays back all music at a constant tempo. You can set the constant tempo with the tempo slider or by typing in a value and selecting a note value above the tempo slider. Tempos are expressed with two decimal points of precision. When the tempo mode is set to Constant, any tempo maps that you may have in the song will be ignored.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Variable</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When set to Variable tempo mode, playback of all sections and songs in FreeStyle will follow the tempo changes in the section and song tempo maps, which can be viewed and edited in the Controllers window. Initially, each tempo map contains a single tempo event at the beginning of the section or song which is equivalent to quarter note = 120.00 bpm. So until you change the tempo map to contain more tempo events, Variable tempo mode will not cause any variation in tempo. To create a tempo map, you can use any of the techniques described in the earlier topic <u>Creating tempo maps</u></font>.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">% Variable</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When set to % Variable tempo mode, playback of all sections and songs in FreeStyle will follow the tempo changes in the section and song tempo maps. However, in this mode you can make everything play relatively a little faster or slower by entering a percentage to be applied to each tempo change in the tempo maps. This percentage is applied purely as output processing, so the original data in your tempo maps will not be modified in any way.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Working with multiple tempo maps</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle always provides one default tempo map for every section and song that you create. Initially, the default tempo map has a constant tempo of 120 bpm. You can add as many tempo changes to it as you like using any of the methods already discussed.<br>
</font>The Tempo source popup menu in the Ensemble palette lets you add an unlimited number of additional tempo maps with the New and Duplicate commands in the menu. Once you created more than one map, use this menu to choose which tempo map you want to be active for the section or song. You can also use the Delete command to get rid of the currently active tempo map.<br>
<img data="bm196.jpg" title="bm196.jpg"><br>
These six tempo maps shown here were created with the 'New' and 'Duplicate' commands at the bottom of the menu. Each one contains a completely different tempo map for Verse 1. You can freely switch between them by choosing their names in this menu. The actual tempo data for the currently active tempo map is shown in the Controller pane in the Graphic Editing window.When you change the tempo map for a section, all songs using that section will change their tempo maps to conform to the new tempos in the section.<br>
Another way to create tempo maps is FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature. When you use Sense Tempo to record a take, a new tempo map appears in the tempo source menu with a name that associates it with that take (such as 'Piano, Take 1'). Whenever you choose a take that was recorded with Sense Tempo, its tempo map automatically becomes active.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Tempo maps and songs</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When you are viewing a song (which you created in the Arrangement Window), the possible tempo maps in the Tempo Source menu are called Song Maps. A Song Map is a tempo map that is created by FreeStyle by piecing together the current tempo map for each section that appears in the top row of the arrangement window. Since the arrangement might change at any time (you might add sections, or edit the current tempo map for a section) the current Song Map will be updated whenever a change is made to the arrangement. Therefore, if you make manual edits directly to a Song Map, you should duplicate it so your edits will not be lost when the program automatically rebuilds the Song Map (with the next arrangement change). For this reason, it is generally a better idea to make all tempo edits to sections, rather than songs.<br>

</font><img data="bm23.jpg" title="bm23.jpg"><br>
Meter changes take effect until the end of the section or until the next meter change, whichever comes first. Also, the meter change is inserted with the following settings from the Change Meter command:<br>
The Scale music to new beat option is turned off. (See 'Scale music to new beat' option in the next topic of this sequence for an explanation of this option.)<br>
The Preserve Tempo of Beat option is turned off, unless you are changing meters in one of the following ways:<br>
2/4, 3/4 or 4/4 changing to 6/8, 9/8 or 12/8<br>
OR<br>
6/8, 9/8 or 12/8 changing to 2/4, 3/4 or 4/4.<br>
If you hold down the shift key when popping up the meter menu, then the meter is inserted with this option turned off, no matter what meters are involved.<br>
The Beat value (in other words, the note duration that 'gets the beat') is the time signature denominator, except for 6/8, 9/8 and 12/8, where it is a dotted quarter note instead.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">The Change Meter window gives you complete control over a meter change operation in the current section or song being viewed. To open this window, choose Change Meter from the Song menu. If you like, you can select some notes before you open the window so that the measure range is pre-set for you. But you can also set the measure range directly in the window. Here is a brief summary of the items in this palette:<br>
</font><img data="bm24.jpg" title="bm24.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Change meter to</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Type in any time signature and pick a beat value with the note popup menu provided. This is the note which will receive the beat, and could be a different duration than the denominator of the time signature. For example, you may wish to beat dotted quarter notes in 6/8 time.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Show meter at current time</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Clicking this box will set the meter, beat and measure fields to values that correspond to the current time position of FreeStyle's playback wiper. If you leave the Change Meter window open while playing or scrubbing the sequence, these values will then update as time changes. This feature is simply a convenience for entering values in this window or for examining the beat values of existing meter changes.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">The range options</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Choose the range of measures you want to change here. The number of measures may change as a result of the Change Meter operation, depending on the options you choose, and the relationship between the original and new meters. For example, if you select two measures of 4/4 and change them to 2/4, you'll end up with four measures of 2/4 (assuming that the Scale music to new beat option is turned off).<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Preserve tempo of beat</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Select this option if you want the tempo of the beat to remain constant from the previous meter to the meter change you are inserting. For example, if the previous bar was 4/4 beating quarter notes and you are adding a meter change at this bar for 6/8 beating dotted quarter notes, then 'Preserve tempo of beat' means you want a dotted quarter note in the new meter to play as fast as a quarter did in the old meter.<br>
</font>This option is turned on by default because it is usually what you want when changing the meter from 4/4 to 6/8 (or 12/8), and vice versa.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Scale music to new beat</font></b><br>
<font size="2">This option does something only if the note value receiving the beat in the previous meter differs from the note value receiving the beat in the new meter change you are inserting. If the note values receiving the beat differ, then this option adjusts the durations of all notes in the measures effected by the meter change according to the ratio of the old beat value to the new beat value.<br>
</font>For example, if you had one measure of 4/4 beating quarters, and the notes in this measure were all triplet 8th notes, and you were changing the meter in this measure to 6/8 beating dotted quarters, then the triplet 8th notes would become two 6/8 measures full of straight 8th notes.<br>
This option is useful for when you have recorded 6/8 material into FreeStyle while FreeStyle was set for 4/4 beating quarter notes, and you would like to change all of the triplet 8ths to straight 8ths with the correct time signature.<font size="3"><br>

Step Recording is the process of entering notes and chords into FreeStyle one at a time from either your computer keyboard or your MIDI instrument. For example, if you were so inclined, you could enter Beethoven's entire Ninth Symphony from your computer keyboard! But Step Recording is great for many everyday tasks, too. It's ideal for entering passages that are too complicated for you to play in real time on your instrument (can you play a septuplet run?). It's also great for entering music when you don't have a MIDI instrument handy. FreeStyle's new event list window is packed full of innovative step-recording features that allow you to accomplish all of these things.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">FreeStyle offers a unique feature called Visual Step Record, which lets you actually see the notes you are about to insert on your computer screen - but before you actually insert them. To turn on this feature, check the 'Insert from MIDI Keyboard option'. Here's an example of how it works. Let's say that you are entering some sheet music into FreeStyle, but you're not that great at reading sheet music. You see a chord on the page that you want to enter into FreeStyle. You press the keys on your MIDI keyboard that you think are the right ones. As you hold them down, FreeStyle writes the chord on screen. But you see immediately that it doesn't match your sheet music. You then try a few other keys, while FreeStyle dynamically updates the chord on the screen. You can keep experimenting until the chord in FreeStyle matches the chord written on your sheet music. Then you can permanently insert the chord, once you've got it right. FreeStyle is ideal for this kind of interactive step-recording because it dynamically updates the display of what you are entering as you enter it.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">The Step Controls let you insert notes using your computer mouse and keyboard. If you check the Insert from MIDI keyboard option, you can also choose the pitches of notes and chords from your MIDI keyboard. If you also check the Advance One Step on Insert option, you can actually insert each note and chord from your MIDI keyboard as soon as you lift your finger(s) from each note or chord. For example, with these two options checked, you can enter a run of sixteenth notes by simply playing the notes, at your leisure, one at a time on your keyboard. Just be sure to release one note before you play the next. Otherwise, you may get a chord of two notes together, rather than two separate notes. One helpful technique is to "peck" at the notes when step recording them, to insure proper separation between each note. Remember, you don't have to worry about the duration you play because the duration is set by the Duration __% of Step option for the note.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">The Event List preferences let you insert notes and empty steps of varying durations - or any type of data you want - by pressing the Function (F) keys along the top of your keyboard.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Note characteristics</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Below the Insert menu are the characteristics of the note that will be next inserted. If you want to 'play' the velocity from your MIDI keyboard, check the 'As Played' box. Notice that the duration of the note can be different than the step size. For example, if you want to insert staccato or legato notes, their duration will likely need to be either less or greater than the step size (depending on the synthesizer sound you are using for the notes being entered).<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Step Size</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The 'Step Size' is the length of time between each inserted note (or step, when you press the step button). For example, if you are inserting staccato quarter notes, the step size would be a quarter note (960 ticks), while the note duration might be around 240 ticks.<br>
</font>If you would like to add any number of ticdks to the current step size duration chosen to the left, type in the desired number in the '+ ___ ticks' box. By combining the step duration with the tick amount here, you create a step size of any tick length.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Using the 'Ticks per quarter note' option</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle can record a real-time performance with a very high degree of precision. To represent this precision, FreeStyle uses a unit of time called a tick. By default, there are 960 ticks per quarter note (ppq).<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">There may be times, however, when you would like to use a different number of ticks per quarter note when step recording. For example, many sources of published MIDI music use a standard of 480 ppq or 240 ppq when printing lists of MIDI data. Or perhaps you use Performer, and you are used to thinking in terms of 480 ppq. Or maybe you would simply find it more convenient to type "96" rather than "960" all the time. FreeStyle adjusts easily to match any of these situations and make the Event List and Step Record features as easy and convenient for you as possible.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">To choose any number of ticks per quarter note, type in the desired value in the Ticks per Quarter Note option, which is just to the right of the Step Size menu.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">The example below shows a quarter note C major scale. On the left, it is being displayed and entered with 960 ticks per quarter note. On the right, it is being displayed with 48 ticks per quarter note. Notice that the Start and End times of the notes are the same. This tells us that the number of ticks per quarter note only affects the display of the notes; it has no effect on their actual location. FreeStyle always stores events internally at 960 ppq, regardless of how the events were entered.<br>

</font><font size="2">The 'Insert from MIDI keyboard' option allows you to choose the pitch of the note - or the pitches of a chord - you are inserting from your MIDI keyboard.<br>
</font>The 'Advance One Step on Insert' check box (to the left) determines what happens when you release the key(s) on your MIDI keyboard. If it's checked, FreeStyle inserts the note or chord when you let go. If it's unchecked, you can hold down any notes you want on your keyboard, freely experimenting until you have exactly the note or chord you want while FreeStyle displays them on your screen. Then, to actually insert them, click the insert button (or press your step trigger, if enabled).<br>
If you want FreeStyle to insert the note(s) with the velocity you played, too, check the 'As Played' box.<br>

If you are playing pitches from your keyboard (with the 'Insert from MIDI keyboard' option), FreeStyle will advance one step as soon as you release each note or chord. This allows you to quickly enter a series of notes or chords from your keyboard.<br>

The Tie button ties the notes in the sense of their musical meaning, but they may not actually be notated with a tie in FreeStyle's notation display.

</font><font size="2">As mentioned earlier, FreeStyle's notation view updates dynamically as you step record. For example, if you turn off the Advance One Step on Insert option, you can watch notes appear and disappear on the screen as you experiment with the note or chord you would like to enter next. As you do so, there may be times, especially on a grand staff, when the notation display might not look quite the way you would expect. This is most often because FreeStyle's transcription engine hasn't had the benefit of seeing what you will enter next. Usually, by the time you finish an entire measure, the transcription will look fine. If the hand-splitting on the grand staff is not quite what you want, you can always tweak it later with the <u>Switch Staff</u></font> command in the Region menu.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Using the keypad to choose step durations</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The keypad on the right-hand side of your computer keyboard lets you choose step durations. This can especially help speed up note insertion from your MIDI keyboard, as you can have one hand on your MIDI keyboard and the other on the keypad. Below is a diagram showing what each key does on the keypad.<br>
</font>Note that the Event List window must be the front-most window for these assignments to be active.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Doubling or halving a note's duration with the + / - keypad keys</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Event List window lets you use the + and - (plus and minus) keys on your computer keypad to increase or decrease a note's duration. To do so, simply select the note in the Event List and then press the plus or minus key on your keypad. The plus key doubles the duration; the minus key halves it.<br>
</font>Note: the Event List must be the front-most window for this to work. To apply the same technique to two or more notes at one time, select them.<br>
If you work with FreeStyle's notation view, here is something to keep in mind when using the plus/minus keys to change durations. The notation view may not always reflect the changes you've made to the durations of the notes. For example, if you have a single note in a measure, and you keep halving its duration, it may not notate any smaller than an eighth note, even though its duration gets as short as 120 ppq. However, if other notes are placed around it, its short 120-tick duration may cause it to retranscribe as a 16th or 32nd note, for example. As you can see, results will vary, depending on the complete musical context in the measure.<br>

</font>Use the Insert Page Number/Insert Part Name commands to insert special text that changes according to what you are viewing. Page numbers always show the number of the visible page. A part name shows the name of the currently visible player when you are viewing only a single player. When you are viewing multiple players, the part name is "Score". You must use the text tool to create a text box before you choose "Insert Page Number" or "Insert Part Name". These commands insert text into an existing text box. FreeStyle will not let you select just part of a page number or part name, but otherwise these bits of text act just like any other word in a text box. You can cut, copy, paste or delete them, and change their font, size, and style just as with any other text.<br>

</font><font size="2">There are two ways to affect the size of the music that FreeStyle will print. If you use the staff size setting in the Page Layout dialog, FreeStyle will show you the page the way it would print. This method affects only the size of your music, leaving staff names and other text unchanged. Since your printer probably has higher resolution than your computer monitor, you may choose a staff size that is too small to view comfortably on your screen. If so, you can use the zoom setting in the lower left of the Notation View to zoom in on the staves.<br>
</font>The other way to change the size of the printed music is to choose a scaling setting in the Print Setup command Options dialog box. If you want everything to be 80% of normal size, type in 80%. Since the size of the paper in your printer doesn't change, FreeStyle changes the size of the white page area in the notation display so that after scaling, it will correspond to the actual page size. This method scales everything that FreeStyle prints, so all text, section names, measure numbers, etc. will come out at 80% of normal size. Also any text you've placed on the page in a specific relation to the margins will probably need to be repositioned after you change the scaling amount.<font size="3"><br>

The piano setting in the clef pop-up menu gives the player two staves, with bass and treble clefs. All the other choices result in a single staff for the player. The ledger line settings in the window control how much space is needed around this player's staff or staves, expressed as a number of ledger lines (equal to the space between two staff lines). When working with a two-staff player ("Piano" clef), the setting called ledger lines between controls how much space appears between the player's two staves.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The word &quot;controller&quot; is shorthand for the MIDI term "continuous controller data", which is a type of MIDI information. Continuous controllers are used to add musical effects that change smoothly over time, such as volume changes (crescendos &amp; decrescendos), amount of vibrato (which often increases in intensity over the duration of a note), and pitch bend to name a few. There are over a hundred types of controllers, although only about 30 are commonly used. In most cases, controllers affect whatever notes are playing at the time that they occur. In addition, they usually consist of a stream of individual data events that change their value over time. For example, a crescendo that occurs over the period of one bar might actually consist of 50 or 60 individual volume control MIDI events spaced only a few fractions of a second apart. In addition, each one has a value that is a little higher than the one before it (controllers have a value range from 0 to 127). To our ears, the net effect sounds like a smooth crescendo.<br>
</font>Since Controllers have this dual nature (individual events that constitute a smooth gesture) FreeStyle displays them in a way that lets you see where each event is, as well as the overall shape. Whenever you see a bracket in the controller view it indicates that there is a single event in effect for the entire duration of the bracket.<br>
Note velocities (the "velocity" of a note determines how loud it is) are the one exception to the way that controllers are displayed. Since there is only one velocity setting for each note, they are drawn as vertical bars, rather than as a connected shape.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">Controllers are inserted, displayed, and edited in the controller grid, which appears right below the note grid in the Graphic Editing view. To display the grid, display the Graphic Editing view and then choose Controllers from the View menu, or press CtrlF11 instead as a shortcut. In FreeStyle's controller grid, you can draw a single controller by clicking once with the pencil tool to achieve a sudden effect, or you can draw a smooth curve by dragging the pencil, line, and curve tools. When inserting controllers, you do so for one player at a time: the currently record-enabled player. So any time you draw controllers, first record-enable the player you want to edit.<font size="3"><br>

The tempo map may consist of one tempo event, several tempo events that produce immediate changes in tempo, or smooth curves that change tempo gradually. The Tempo source menu (<u>Ensemble palette</u></font>) controls which map is currently visible.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">FreeStyle is intelligent about editing controllers with notes</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Many sequencers treat notes and controllers completely separately, and they leave it up to you to remember to edit the controllers after you edit the notes they affect. For example, if you copy some notes that also have a crescendo, you'd need to remember to copy and paste the crescendo after doing so with the notes.<br>
</font>FreeStyle helps you out by automatically selecting controllers when you select notes by dragging a selection box over them. When you copy or modify the notes, the controller information will come along for the ride. FreeStyle decides whether or not to auto-select the controller information based on the amount of overlap that the selected notes have with the other notes around them. Since there are times when FreeStyle may not select controllers you want it to, or may select ones you don't, you should keep the controllers view open if you are not sure what is happening. Also, if you find that you do not like the decisions that FreeStyle makes about when to select controllers, there is a preference to turn auto selection off.<br>
FreeStyle also gives you a hand when it comes to pasting controllers. In other sequencers, when you paste controller information on top of other controller information, the events are simply merged together. This almost always yields horrible sounding results. FreeStyle takes a more intelligent approach. It looks at the controllers that are being merged together, and if there is a conflict it only keeps the controllers you are pasting. What you are pasting always takes precedence over the destination. In this way the notes that you paste will sound the same as when they were copied. (You can reverse this behavior by checking the "keep destination controllers" preference.) <br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Playback loops<font size="1"> (1 of 9)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Playback loops</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">There are two kinds of loops that you can use in FreeStyle. A Record Loop causes time to cycle between two points. Whenever the end of a record loop is reached, the time wiper jumps back to the beginning of the loop and all players start playing whatever notes they have recorded at that time. A record loop is merely a convenience for recording notes repeatedly over the same section of time.<br>
</font>A playback loop, on the other hand, does not affect the passage of time at all. It affects the performance of a single take by a single player in a single section of music. When you create a playback loop for a take, you are asking FreeStyle to repeat one or more bars of the take for some number of times. For example, you could record one bar of a drum groove and create a playback loop which would cause that one bar to repeat four times, or until the end of the section. But while the drum notes are repeating, the time wiper will continue to move forward normally so other players can play normally. If the piano player does not have a playback loop, then when the wiper is in bar 4 the piano will be playing the notes that it has in bar 4, but the drummer will be playing the third repeat of the notes that it has in bar 1.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Advantages of playback loops</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Using a playback loop has a few benefits. First, it saves time. You don't have to copy and paste your one bar of drum notes many times to get the effect you want. Secondly, it saves memory in the computer. It takes less space to store one bar of notes with the directions to repeat those notes ten times than it does to store ten identical copies of the notes. Thirdly, it's convenient to edit. When you change a note that is part of a playback loop, the note will change for all repeats of the note as well.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Playback loop overrides</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle has an extra feature for playback loops called loop overrides. Loop overrides make it possible for you to make changes to measures within a playback loop without affecting the other repeating measures in the loop. For example, suppose you have a 1-bar drum pattern that is looping throughout your entire chorus. If you want to add a couple of fills here and there but leave the rest of the loop intact, you can just override the loop for the bars you want to change. In fact, if you just want to overdub your changes on top of the existing loop, FreeStyle will automatically make loop overrides for the measures that you record on top of.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Using playback loops to build a drum part</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Here is an excellent approach for developing a drum part. Start by using a Riff Metronome so you have a drum beat to play to while you record your other parts. When the rest of your music is in place and you want to finalize your drum part, use the Become Player button in the Metronome dialog to convert your Riff Metronome into an editable drum player. For sections that are longer than the metronome riff, the Become Player button will create a playback loop for the new drum player's current take which will repeat the drum riff until the end of the section. Next, override just the drum measures you want to change using one of the methods described below. Change the notes in the overridden measures, and you're done!<br>
</font>Here are some other things to keep in mind when using playback loops: The markers that show playback loop definitions appear only in the graphic editing view's time line. They aren't visible in the notation view. In the graphic editing view, original notes appear with rounded edges and repeated notes appear with square edges. In the notation view, repeated notes are indistinguishable from original notes. <font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">To create a playback loop for a player, first record-enable the player that you want to loop and select the take which you want to affect. Then switch to the graphic editing view by clicking on the graphic editing button and use one of the following two methods:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Looping the selected notes: with the arrow tool, drag a selection box around the notes that you want to repeat. They will turn white to indicate that they are selected. Choose Create Play Loop from the Region menu. Loop markers will appear in the time line to indicate the beginning of the loop source material, the end of the loop source material, and the end of the last repetition of the loop.<br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Looping the current measure: If any notes are selected, deselect them by clicking on empty space in the graphic editing grid. Click in the time line to position the time wiper within a measure that you wish to contain the source material for the loop. Choose Create Play Loop from the Region menu. Loop markers will appear in the time line to indicate the beginning of the loop source material, the end of the loop source material, and the end of the last repetition of the loop.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm49.jpg" title="bm49.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">If loop markers do not appear in the time line, try zooming time in with the zoom slider (magnifying glass) in the lower left of the editing window. Loop markers do not appear in the time line when you are zoomed way out and measure lines are very close together. If zooming doesn't make them appear, then you have the wrong player selected or the wrong take selected.<br>

Dragging the loop source end marker will shorten or extend the loop source area without affecting the loop source start point. Dragging the loop extent marker will change the number of repeats in the loop. If the loop extent marker is dragged so it lines up with the section end double-lines in the graphic editing view, then the loop will automatically resize when the section size changes (it will always loop until the end of the section). Loop Override markers cannot be dragged -- they can only be selected and deleted.<font size="3"><br>

</font></font><font size="2">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Manual override: Click in the time line to position the time wiper within the measure that you wish to override. You must choose one of the repeating measures within the loop, not one of the loop source measures. Choose "Override Play Loop" from the Region menu. <br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Automatic override: With the record button on in the control palette, play new notes anywhere within the loop. If you play into the source measures of the loop, all repeats of the loop will receive the new notes and no override will be created. If you play into a repeat bar of the loop, the new material appears only in that measure.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">To delete a playback loop override within an existing playback loop, first select the take that contains the loop and show only that take's player in the graphic editing view. Playback loop markers will appear in the time line. Click on the override marker in the measure that you wish to revert and press the delete key to delete the override. When the override is removed, the take will revert to playing and showing ghosts of the original looping notes (with square edges). It is important to note that deleting an override does not delete whatever extra notes were recorded within the override. If you override the measure again, those notes will appear again. If you want the notes in your override to be deleted as well, select them and delete them before you delete the override marker. <br>
</font>When you add a playback loop to a take which contains existing notes beyond the end of the loop source, the playback loop will act like an opaque layer on top of whatever notes were previously recorded. Repeating notes will temporarily obscure whatever used to be in the repeat bars until the playback loop is removed -- at which time the old notes will become visible again. When you override a playback loop in a given measure, it is like cutting a hole in the opaque layer and looking through to the raw take underneath. Hence, if you add a playback loop to a take which obscures a group of old notes, you may be surprised to find them popping up in your override measures. To avoid this, delete unwanted notes from a take before adding a playback loop.<font size="3"><br>

Just open them in FreeStyle (using Open in the File menu), edit the notes, and save again as a standard MIDI file in the FREESTYL\METRONOM directory. To get rid of a riff entirely, remove it from the directory.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">FreeStyle's "riff" metronome is probably one of the most musical metronomes you've ever encountered. A riff can be any musical phrase you want. FreeStyle provides a list of stock drum loops as riffs, but you can make your own riffs out of anything, such as a bass part or keyboard lick. To use a riff, choose it from the pop-up menu as shown below. To add your own riff to the menu, either save it into FreeStyle's metronom directory as a standard MIDI file using the Save As command, or select anything you've recorded into FreeStyle and use the Save As Metronome command in the Region menu. Then start jamming. Once you've got some ideas down, you can convert the metronome riff into a player using the Become Player button below to fine-tune it.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">Remote controls let you control all of FreeStyle's transport controls and recording features from your MIDI keyboard. They are designed so that you can record an entire song from start to finish without ever touching your computer. You can assign a FreeStyle command to any key on your MIDI keyboard. In order to use the key as a remote control, you first hold down a command trigger so FreeStyle knows you are not just playing a note. The trigger can be a single controller, such as a foot pedal, or it can be a "clump" of keys that you would never want to play simultaneously while recording. You can smoothly switch between recording and "remote controlling" FreeStyle by pressing and releasing the trigger keys.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">FreeStyle has standard Windows cut, copy, and paste commands in the Edit menu. These simple features give you an amazing amount of control over your music. You can "slice and dice" your music in much the same way that you can rearrange text in a word processor. You can use copy and paste to move music around or make repeating variations on a figure. And since FreeStyle lets you work with multiple documents at the same time, you can even copy bits from one piece of music into another.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Cut and Copy</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The copy command places a copy of everything selected onto the clipboard. (Cut works the same, except that the selected events are then deleted.) It stays on the clipboard until you copy something else. You can copy any selection of notes and controllers, even if there is more than one Player involved. This lets you move entire stretches of music in a single operation.<br>
</font>When you copy notes that are in a playback loop, only the source notes are copied to the clipboard; the notes generated by the playback loop (i.e. the notes in the playback loop with the squared-off edges) do not copy.<br>
When you copy while viewing a song, a copy of the selection will be placed on the clipboard for each instance of its section in the current song. For example if I have put five copies of "Chorus" in my song, and I copy some music from "Chorus" I will wind up with five repetitions of the events on the clipboard. This may or may not be what you intended. In general it is less confusing and error prone to copy and paste when viewing a section.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Paste</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Paste places the contents of the clipboard into the current document. There are two ways to determine where the music gets pasted. By default, FreeStyle places the music in the same measure that the wiper is in and maintains the relationship the music originally had with the bar line. In other words, if the music you copied started on beat three of the measure it was in, then it will be placed at beat three of whatever measure the wiper is in. This is called "measure-relative" pasting, and it makes copying and pasting quick and easy. It lets you quickly duplicate chunks of music without needing to precisely position the wiper.<br>
</font>In some situations, you may prefer to have more control over the exact location where the music is placed. If you un-check "Paste measure relative" in the General section of the Preferences dialog, FreeStyle will paste relative to the current brush/cursor grid setting, rather than the bar line. For example, if you copied a note that began on beat three plus a sixteenth note, then pasted with a grid setting of one quarter note with the wiper near beat two, the note would be placed at beat two plus a sixteenth note, thus maintaining its original relationship to a quarter note grid.<br>

If any of the players are no longer selected in the ensemble window, or if you are pasting into a different document that does not have players that match, you will be given the option of selecting destinations for the music as shown below. FreeStyle will temporarily remember the relationships you set up in this dialog, and try to use them the next time you paste. This lets you perform multiple copy/paste operations without needing to reset all the relationships each time.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">When viewing a song in the editing window, you may be looking at several sections that are playing simultaneously. So if you paste into this view, which section gets your pasted notes? FreeStyle always picks the section in the top-most row in the arrangement window. Generally this will be row 1, the primary song structure row. If the music on the clipboard is longer than can fit into the section, FreeStyle will place the extra music into the next section in the same row. Sometimes this is exactly what you want, but other times it will yield results you did not intend. In general it is less confusing and error prone to copy and paste while viewing a single section.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">Suppose you want Bass notes to be recorded one octave lower than where you play them on your keyboard. Record-enable the Bass player in the ensemble window by clicking on the record button to the left of the name "Bass." Then choose "Edit Player Info" from the Setup menu.

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Automatic instrument transposition</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Many Player Library Entries are preset to do an automatic instrument transposition in the notation view whenever a player of that type is displayed by itself. For example, choose "Edit Player Library" from the "Player Library" sub-menu in the Setup menu. Choose "Clarinet" from the "Player Library Entry" popup menu at the top of the dialog. In the box within the dialog labelled "Notation", you will see that "Transpose Part" has been set to B flat. This is because a clarinet is a B flat instrument. A Clarinet part played in the concert key of C will be transposed up a full step to the key of D when the part is displayed or printed by itself. This type of transposition does not affect the pitch of a player at all, only the way that it is notated.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Transposing pitch without changing key signature</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">You can accomplish this task in FreeStyle in one of two ways. First, you can just select the notes you want to change and drag them up or down in the graphic editing or notation view to change pitches. Or, you can select some notes and use the Transpose palette. To make the Transpose palette appear, choose "Transpose" from the Region menu. Adjust the settings in the window and click the Transpose button to offset the pitches of all selected notes by the desired amount. If you don't have any notes selected, the Transpose button won't do anything.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Changing key signature without transposing pitch</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Suppose you just recorded a piano part in the key of D, but when you look at the notation view you see that it was written in the key of C. The pitches are correct, but the notation view doesn't know what key you want. To fix this, click on the treble or bass clef symbol at the left edge of any staff (you'll know you're in the right place when the cursor changes to a '#/b' symbol). A popup menu of all the possible key signatures will appear. Choose the appropriate key signature and the notation view will update its transcription of your recording. You can also use the Change Key command in the Song menu to accomplish the same thing.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm21.jpg" title="bm21.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">If you need to insert a key change in the middle of a section, hold down the option key and move the cursor over the barline that defines the beginning of the measure where you want to insert it. (Again, you'll know you're in the right place when the cursor changes to a '#/b' symbol.) Click the barline with the &quot;#/b&quot; cursor and choose the desired key from the pop-up menu. You can also enter a key change over a range of measures using the Change Key dialog, which is opened from the Song menu.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Transposing pitch and changing key signature at the same time</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Suppose you played a Piano part in the key of C and decide later that you would like to hear it in the key of D. In this case you want to change the key signature and also transpose the pitch of every note up by a full step.<br>
</font>There are two ways to do this. One is to use the Change Key command in the Song menu. The Change Key dialog has a check box called Transpose Notes. When it is checked, FreeStyle transposes all notes affected by the key change. If you have a drum player, however, you should use the Transpose dialog to restore the drum notes back to their original pitches.<br>
The other approach is a simple, two-step operation: first change the key and then transpose the notes. See the two previous help topics for how to do each step. Of course, if you are only working in the graphic editing view you don't have to bother changing the key signature until you want to display or print music notation.<br>
Be careful not to transpose notes that belong to drum players.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">When you transpose your music by any of these methods, FreeStyle is very good about choosing how to spell the notes. It takes many factors into account, including the pitch of the note, the key signature, the mode (major or minor), and even the musical context of the note. For example, is the note in an ascending melodic line? If so, FreeStyle will tend to use a sharp instead of a flat. You can, at any time, override FreeStyle's choice for a note spelling by double-clicking the note and choosing a different spelling in the Note Detail dialog. For complete details about note spelling, see the 'Note Spellings' topic.<font size="3"><br>

It can accommodate notes on even beat divisions as well as triplet divisions in one pass. In essence, what you see in the Notation view is exactly how the music will be quantized, except Notation based quantize does not change note durations.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Players are one of FreeStyle's fundamental building blocks. A player has a lot of control over its music, from how it sounds to how it is displayed in the notation view. Since it would be tedious to set up all this information each time you create a new player FreeStyle gives you a powerful short-cut: The Player Library. The player library stores commonly used "Forms" or "Templates" that you can use to create Players from.<br>
</font>You can think of a Player Template as a "Rubber Stamp" for creating Players. Extending the metaphor, if you modify a rubber stamp, it does not affect "prints" that have already been made with it, only the ones it will make in the future. If you modify a print, it does not change the stamp, or any other prints. Player Templates work the same way. Changing a Player Template does not affect Players that have already been made, only ones that you make from that point forward. Similarly, modifying a Player, either in the Ensemble window, or in the "Edit Player Info" dialog does not affect the Player Template it was created from, or Players in other documents.<br>
To summarize, a Player Template is a "stamp" that you can use to create a Player. After the Player is created it is no longer tied to the Template that created it in any way.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">Resist the temptation to create one player template for each sound on your MIDI device. Instead, think of a player template as a category of instrument, such as brass, or even a more specific classification, such as piano. Player templates are useful for making players that are more or less what you're after. No doubt once a player is created you will want to refine it to suit your piece. For example you should probably only have one "Piano" player template that can be used to create players that will actually become grand piano, honky tonk piano, or harpsichord. On the other hand, if you are constantly using a Fender Rhodes keyboard sound, then it would, for convenience sake, make sense to add a Fender Rhodes player template. It's up to you to create a Player Library that fits the way you work.<font size="3"><br>

<b><font color="#0000a0">Part transposition</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The part transposition settings affect how players created from this template will be notated when viewed in an instrument part (individually). It does not change the way the Players will sound. Enter the standard transposition for the instrument you are describing. For example, you would enter Bb for a Bb Clarinet. (The up/down pop-up menu has no effect if zero octaves is entered.) For Baritone Sax you would enter Eb and 1 octave up, since it is notated one octave and a major sixth above concert pitch.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Score transposition</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The score transposition settings affect how players created from this template will be notated when viewed in a score (with other players). The default score transposition is C natural (concert pitch). But you might want to change it. For example, bass parts often end up with too many ledger lines below the staff. You could set the score (and part) transposition up an octave to make the part easier to read. Here's another example: if you prefer to see instruments in their transposed form in the score (instead of in concert pitch), you can set the score transposition to match the part transposition.<br>

</font><font size="2">In the same way that it would be tedious to re-enter all your player settings every time you created a player, it would be annoying to have to add your favorite players one at a time to each new document. FreeStyle has a short-cut: The Ensemble Library.<br>
</font>An Ensemble Library Entry is a collection of player templates that can be added to a document in one shot. Whenever you create a document, FreeStyle asks you to pick an ensemble library entry. It then creates players from each of the player templates in the ensemble. <br>
The Edit Ensemble Library command in the Setup menu lets you setup and modify your own Ensembles.<font size="3"><br>

</font><img data="bm187.jpg" title="bm187.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The main purpose of the Tweak Notes feature is to scale velocities or durations for selected notes. The possible choices are:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Louder<br>

</font></font><font size="2">Some of these modes display a slider in the dialog that you can move during playback to make adjustments in real time as you listen to the music. Those that don't present you with Apply and Unapply buttons to experiment with in real time before you make changes by clicking OK. You can even set up a record loop over the area you want to tweak so it will repeat as you tweak the settings in real time. This is a great way to interactively adjust the feel of your music.<br>
</font>The apply gradually option allows you to create crescendos and poco a poco effects by gradually applying the chosen effect more and more over the range of the selected notes.<br>
The first four options have a slider for setting values. When using these options, the effect is immediate and does not need to be 'applied'.<br>
The next four options do not have a slider. Instead, they have only numerical fields and duration pop-ups for setting values. When using these options, you must click on the Apply button to apply the tweak to the selected notes.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Choose Notes<font size="1"> (1 of 1)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Choose Notes command lets you highlight notes selectively based on their pitch, location, duration and velocity. Conversely, it also allows you to remove notes from a current selection (unhighlight them) based on these same characteristics.<br>
</font>You can use the Choose Notes command with or without notes already selected, depending on what you would like to do. If you start with notes already selected, Choose Notes lets you select more notes, or selectively unhighlight some of the already selected notes. For example, you could select all the notes in your chorus section (with the Select All command), and then use Choose Notes to deselect all of the notes that have a duration of a sixteenth note or less.<br>
<img data="bm34.jpg" title="bm34.jpg"><br>
In the example above, Choose Notes is targeting all notes between C3 and C4 that are located within measure 1, beat 3 and measure 5, beat 3 with durations between a sixteenth and an 8th note and velocities between 80 and 110. You could select them by clicking the Add button or deselect them by clicking Remove.The Remove and Add buttons allow you to make multiple additions and omissions from the currently selected notes before you click OK to exit the dialog. For example, you could first add all notes with durations longer than a quarter note and then remove all notes with velocities over 100. You can use the Add and Remove buttons as many times as you like before you click OK. This allows you to make your selection criteria as detailed and complicated as you like.<font size="3"><br>

<b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Note Spellings<font size="1"> (1 of 1)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">A note spelling is the pitch and accidental used in the notation view to display a note on the staff (or grand staff). When FreeStyle displays notes in the notation view, it pays close attention to musical context, key signature, and mode (major or minor). FreeStyle also allows you to manually override the choices it makes for note spellings in the Note Detail dialog, which you can open by double-clicking on any note.<br>
</font><img data="bm102.jpg" title="bm102.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Manually adjusting how a note is spelled</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When you double-click a note, the Note Detail dialog opens. This dialog allows you to choose how the note will be spelled. Most of the time, FreeStyle does a good job of deciding how to spell a note, given the musical context, key signature and mode (major or minor). So you can just leave the Note Spelling setting on Auto.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Speeding up the notation display by turning off 'Smart Note Spellings'</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The in-depth analysis that FreeStyle performs on your music to spell notes correctly takes time. If you have a slower computer, you can speed up the time it takes FreeStyle to draw notation by turning off Smart Note Spellings for the current document in the Notation sub-menu of the Setup menu. If you would also like this option to be disabled in all newly created documents, uncheck the Smart Note Spellings option in the Notation Preferences dialog (which can be opened by choosing Preferences from the Edit menu). When the Smart Note Spellings option is turned off, FreeStyle still spells notes correctly according to the current key signature and mode (major or minor), but it does not analyze the musical context of the note. In most cases, FreeStyle's choices for note spelling are still quite acceptable, and you can always manually tweak individual note spellings. (The 'Auto' option means that FreeStyle will choose the spelling.)<br>
</font>If, however, you prefer the way notes are spelled with Smart Note Spellings turned on, you can leave it turned off while you are recording, editing and mixing your music in order to take advantage of the improved responsiveness. Then, right before you print your notation, you can turn Smart Note Spellings back on.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Locking player MIDI channels<font size="1"> (1 of 1)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Normally, FreeStyle dynamically manages the MIDI channel assignments of the players in your ensemble so you don't have to think about such technical details. You simply choose a sound in your synthesizer (such as 'Honky Tonk Piano') for a player in the Ensemble palette sound pop-up menu. FreeStyle knows all about the sounds in your synthesizer and knows what MIDI channels each sound can play on, so FreeStyle then automatically assigns the player to an eligible MIDI channel in the instrument. FreeStyle may even borrow other MIDI channels on the fly during playback, if necessary, if the MIDI instrument wouldn't otherwise be able to play all the notes. All of this goes on 'under the hood' so you don't have to worry about it.<br>
</font>There may be times, however, when you want to take control over the MIDI channel assignments of your players. For example, you may have an instrument that does not lend itself to FreeStyle's dynamic channel allocation. In cases like this, FreeStyle allows you to specify a desired MIDI channel for the sound that a player uses rather than doing so automatically for you.When you check the 'Lock Player Channels in Ensemble Window' option in the General Preferences window (opened from the Edit menu), a Channel column appears in the Ensemble window as shown. Selecting a channel for a player forces FreeStyle to use the selected channel for playing that sound. No other player may lock to the same channel on the same device. For more information on channel locking, see <u>Sound Changes</u> and <u>Layered Sounds and Channel Locking</u>.<br>

</font></font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Layered Sounds<font size="1"> (1 of 3)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">A layered sound is when a single player plays a blend of two or more sounds at the same time. For example, the player might be set up to play a pan flute sound on one MIDI instrument, while at the same time playing a muted trumpet sound on another MIDI instrument. The result sounds like the two instruments are playing in unison with one another.<br>
</font>FreeStyle lets you create your own layered sounds using the sounds provided by your MIDI instruments. You can include as many individual sounds as you want in a layered sound. Each layer can even have its own volume and pan settings. You can also lock individual layers to a specific MIDI channel, if necessary. (For complete information about channel locking, see <u>Locking player MIDI channels</u>.)<br>
Once you've created your own layered sounds, they appear under the Layered Sounds item when you click in the Sound column in the Ensemble palette as shown below.<br>

</font><b><font color="#0000a0">A shortcut for creating layered sounds and adding layers</font></b><br>
<font size="2">To easily add a layer to a player's current sound, hold down the Shift key while choosing a sound in the Sound column in the Ensemble palette. When the sound is chosen, a new layer will be automatically created for it. If the current sound is not a layered sound, a new layered sound will be created containing two layers: the original sound in one layer and the newly-selected sound in the other. If the old sound was already a layered sound, the definition for that sound will be altered to include the new layer, and any other player using that layered sound will be changed accordingly.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'official' way to create a layered sound</font></b><br>
<font size="2">To create and edit layered sounds, choose Edit Layered Sounds from the Setup menu. The Layered Sound Library dialog appears as shown below. If the currently record-enabled player is using a layered sound, that sound will be displayed.<br>
</font><img data="bm52.jpg" title="bm52.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">If a player in the current ensemble is using a layered sound, edits made to that sound will be heard immediately. If a layered sound is deleted, any player using the sound will automatically be assigned to another sound instead.<br>
</font>Layered Sounds are saved as part of the FreeStyle Libraries file (like player library entries).If a player uses a layered sound, the definition of that sound is also stored with the FreeStyle document itself, so that the document can be used by another FreeStyle user who doesn't have that layered sound in their FreeStyle Libraries yet. When the other person opens the document, the layered sound definition will automatically be added to his or her library of layered sounds.<br>
Each layer of the layered sound is displayed separately in its own panel. Each layer has its own, unique sound, as well as unique settings for volume, pan and, if necessary, MIDI channel.<br>
To select a layer (for deleting), click anywhere on the layer panel. The heavy border indicates that it is selected.<br>
The 'Delete Layer' button gets rid of the currently selected layer. It is grayed out until you select a layer as described above.<br>
Click 'New' to create a new layered sound. The new layered sound will have two layers. To add more layers, use the 'Add Layer' button. To view and edit an existing layered sound, choose it from the menu at the top of the window.<br>
The volume and pan settings for a layer are relative to the other layers. The overall volume and pan are still controlled by the Player's volume and pan settings in the Ensemble palette, or by volume and pan continuous controller data.<br>
Use the buttons at the bottom to rename, delete or duplicate the current layered sound (as indicated by the menu at the top of the window).<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Overview</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A Sound Change is when a player changes the sound it is using in mid-performance. For example, if the Guitar player wants to use a 'distorted' sound for 8 bars and a 'clean' sound for the next 8, but still be considered (displayed, notated, etc.) as the same part, a Sound Change could be inserted which would select the 'clean' sound at the appropriate moment. Unlike conventional MIDI 'patch changes,' FreeStyle's Sound Changes allow the player to switch to a completely different device at any time to play its sounds. Sound Changes can even involve layered sounds.<br>
</font><img data="bm159.jpg" title="bm159.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Editing Sound Changes in the Controllers Window</font></b><br>
<font size="2">To insert a sound change, open the Controllers window, and select 'Sound Changes' as the type. The tools are the standard I-beam tool for selecting and a flag tool for inserting sound changes. Select the flag tool and click in the Controllers window at the time when the sound should change. A Sound Change 'flag' appears, showing the sound and channel of the current sound. Use the Sound menu inside the flag to choose the sound you would like the player to change to at the time location of the flag.<br>
</font>To insert, view and edit sound changes for a player, display the controller pane (by choosing 'Controllers' from the View menu) and then choose 'Sound Changes' from the 'Type' menu.<br>
When you first insert a sound change, it displays the current sound for the player. Choose the sound you want from the Sound menu inside the sound change flag.<br>
Use the I-beam and flag tools to select and insert sound changes (respectively).<br>
If you drag horizontally with the Flag tool, two Sound Change flags are inserted: one at the start and one at the end of the region you've dragged. This is useful if you would like to change the sound and then change it back sometime later. Any existing Sound Changes within the region you dragged over are removed.<br>
To delete a sound change, click the flag to select it (the 'flagpole' appears hollow) and use the Cut command (or press the delete key). You can shift-click to select more than one Sound Change flag. Alternatively, you can use the I-Beam tool to select all of the sound changes in a region.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Sound Changes and the Ensemble palette</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The Ensemble palette always shows the current sound for a player. When a Sound Change occurs, the Ensemble palette updates to reflect the new sound and channel for the player that changed. Also, selecting a sound or channel in the Ensemble palette alters the most recently-occurring sound change. To alter a playerŐs default sound, the playback wiper must be placed before any Sound Changes.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Sound Changes and Channel Locking</font></b><br>
<font size="2">If a player has a sound change which locks a sound to a device and channel, no other player can lock to that channel, even if the locked sound is not currently active.<font size="3"><br>

</font></font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Beat Adjustment Overview<font size="1"> (1 of 1)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">What is beat adjustment?</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Beat Adjustment is when you tell FreeStyle where the beats are in a musical performance that for some reason does not match FreeStyle's beats and barlines. This situation would arise, for example, if you turned off FreeStyle's metronome and then recorded a piece of music without FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature. While FreeStyle counts away internally at a straight 120 beats per minute, you might be playing a free-flowing rubato performance with tempos around 86 beats per minute. The result is that what you record would not match up with FreeStyle's measure and beat counter in the Control palette or the measure and beat ruler in the Graphic Editing window. Most significantly, the transcription of your performance in FreeStyle's notation view will be completely unrecognizable because FreeStyle would try to write your music as if you did play along with the metronome.<br>
</font><img data="bm9.jpg" title="bm9.jpg"><br>
Another common situation in which this condition arises is when you import a standard MIDI file that contains material recorded in another sequencer without a metronome.FreeStyle's beat adjustment features give you a host of powerful tools to correct FreeStyle's beats. The result is that FreeStyle's counter, measure/beat rulers and notation transcription accurately reflect the measures and beats of your music. The music notation becomes recognizable and readable, and you can use FreeStyle's many features, such as Quantizing, that are based on where notes are in the measure. Best of all, your original performance is preserved; it will play exactly the same as it did before you performed beat adjustment.<br>
Even if you don't use FreeStyle's notation display (or you don't plan to print out notation), it is still useful for FreeStyle to know where the beats and barlines are so that you can use FreeStyle's many other metrically dependent features, such as quantizing.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Your original performance is always preserved</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The best part about beat adjustment -- and the most important thing to remember about it -- is: beat adjustment never changes the timing or the feel of your performance. What you hear after using FreeStyle's beat adjustment features will always sound exactly like what you originally played. FreeStyle accomplishes this by moving the notes around metrically but at the same time generating precisely calculated tempo changes placed at exactly the right time. FreeStyle makes sure that the combination of the new tempo map with the newly aligned notes, when played back, produces exactly the same performance as before.<br>
</font>As you can probably tell by now, beat adjustment is not quantizing. Really, it's just the opposite. Quantizing moves note to the nearest beat (or grid location). Beat adjustment moves the beat (or grid location) to the nearest appropriate note.<br>
Another way to think of it is this: when you drag a note in FreeStyle, you are changing the performance to make that note play at a different time. When you drag a beat line in FreeStyle, the performance stays the same but the notation and the tempo map change. It is often useful to open the controller window and display Tempos before beginning to adjust beats so you can see how FreeStyle is adjusting your tempo map as you drag the beat lines.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Switching between the music's original timing and a constant tempo</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Another benefit of adjusting beats is that it allows you to freely switch between the music's original tempo and feel -- even a very rubato performance -- and a constant tempo. Why? Because FreeStyle's beat adjustment features generate a tempo map that preserves your original performance. You can then use the tempo modes in the Control palette to play your music with or without the tempo map. To hear your music's original tempo, timing and feel, you would choose the variable tempo mode. To hear your music at a constant tempo, you would choose constant. For a further explanation of these options (including % variable, which lets you hear your music faster or slower but with its original timing and feel), see 'The Tempo Mode settings' on-line help topic.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">FreeStyle provides both manual and automatic beat adjustment</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle provides three different beat adjustment features, each tuned to certain circumstances:<br>
</font>1. Adjust Beats (Song menu)<br>
2. Record Beats (Song menu)<br>
3. Identify Beats (Region menu)<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Adjust Beats</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Adjust beats lets you drag FreeStyle's beats and bars as vertical lines in the Graphic Editing view to align them with the notes displayed there. Adjust beats can be used to tweak a single beat or an entire song.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Record Beats</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Record beats lets you tell FreeStyle where the beats are in your music by tapping along with your music as it plays back. Since it can be difficult to precisely anticipate every beat consistently as you listen (especially in a rubato performance), you will probably find it necessary to tweak things with Adjust beats afterwards. Record Beats gets you 'in the ball park', and Adjust Beats lets you clean up the few beats that you may have missed slightly.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Identify Beats</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Identify Beats lets you identify beats by selecting notes that should fall on the beat. It works well in either the Graphic Editing view or the Notation view.These three features are explained in detail in the following three help topics:<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Overview</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Record Beats is one of FreeStyle's three beat adjustment features. For a summary of them, see <u>Beat Adjustment Overview</u></font>.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Record Beats feature allows you to tap along with the playback of a rubato performance in order to tell FreeStyle where the beats are. To use Record Beats, choose Record Beats from the Song menu.<br>
</font><img data="bm118.jpg" title="bm118.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'Start button is first beat' option</font></b><br>
<font size="2">There are two ways to record beats. If the music begins at an odd time with no means of anticipating the first note, then it would be hard to tap exactly on the first note. In this case, choose Start button is first beat. Before entering the dialog, position the playback wiper to exactly the start time of the first note which is on the beat value you are going to tap. You can do this easily by double-clicking on the note to see its exact start time, and then typing those values into the counter fields in the control palette. To begin, choose Record Beats from the Song menu. Then, click the play button or press the space bar, which represents your first tap. Then begin tapping on your MIDI controller where the next beat should be.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'Tap is first beat' option</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The second way to record beats is when the first beat of your music happens at a location that is easy to anticipate. For example, you may have recorded a measure of clicks before the first note. If so, rewind to any point before the first note before choosing Record Beats from the Song menu. Choose the Tap is first beat option. Then click on the Start button (or hit the space bar) and begin tapping on the first note that falls on the beat value you specified.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Hearing what you are tapping</font></b><br>
<font size="2">While tapping, you will hear the sound of whatever player you have record-enabled. But don't worry: the notes you are tapping will not be recorded for that player. They go into a special buffer which FreeStyle uses only for creating a tempo map and adjusting the placement of beats in your performance. You might want to record-enable a drum player so you can tap using a percussive sound.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'Shift to' option</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When you are trying to adjust the beats of a performance that was recorded without a metronome, in most cases the performance doesn't start at the correct measure and beat. For example, musically, the first note of the performance might be a pickup note that starts two beats before the downbeat of measure 1 (i.e. measure zero, beat 3). But since the performance was recorded without a metronome, the first note is probably located at an arbitrary place, such as measure 5, beat 2, tick 237.<br>
</font>When this is the case, you can use the Shift to option to make the Record Beats operation move your entire performance for you such that it starts at the desired measure and beat. Just type in the desired measure and beat, and the Record Beats operation will put the first note at the location you indicate.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Like all beat adjustment operations, your original performance will be entirely preserved.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Using Adjust Beats after Record Beats</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Depending on the music, it can sometimes be difficult to tap precisely on every beat during a long performance. After you finish recording beats, you can use the Adjust Beats feature to tweak sections that you may not have nailed precisely.<font size="3"><br>

<b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Identify Beats<font size="1"> (1 of 2)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Identify Beats feature is one of FreeStyle's three beat adjustment features. For a summary of them, see <u>Beat Adjustment Overview</u></font>.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">To use this dialog, select some notes that you would like to use as indicators of where the beats are in the music, and then choose Identify Beats from the Region menu.<br>
</font><img data="bm74.jpg" title="bm74.jpg"><br>
The Identify Beats feature can be used with either the notation or the graphic editing views. The most common way to use it is to open the notation view, select all the notes that you want to begin on, say, quarter note boundaries, and then use this dialog to make FreeStyle re-transcribe the music accordingly. Or, select a few notes right where a Sense Tempo recording's notation seems to have gone awry, and use this dialog to tell Sense Tempo what the separation between those notes should be.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">As with all of FreeStyle's beat adjustment operations, Identify Beats will not change the performance of the music. See 'Your original performance is always preserved' in <u>Beat Adjustment Overview</u></font>.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Identify Beats Settings<font size="1"> (2 of 2)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'First selected note becomes' setting</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Enter values here for the measure, beat, and tick where you would like the first selected note to start. When the Identify Beats dialog opens, these fields will be filled in to show where the first selected note will go by default. When you change the Identify Beats Mode pop-up or the Grid is pop-up to a different value, these fields will update again to show a new default location.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">'Shift to first note' vs. 'Stretch beat to first note'</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When 'Shift to first note' is selected, the entire performance of notes within the range of the selected notes will be shifted so the first note will sound at the time given in the First selected note becomes fields. Unlike almost all of FreeStyle's other beat adjustment features, this option will actually change the performance of the original material, since it expands or reduces the amount of time between the selected notes and other notes before or after the selected range. However, for large corrections this is sometimes the only way to accomplish the task, since there is a limit to how much a tempo map can be changed. Also, this option is very useful for placing the first note when you begin to beat-correct an entire performance.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">When 'Stretch beat to first note' is selected, the positioning of the first selected note will be accomplished entirely by modifying the tempo map in the beat area immediately preceding the selected note. This option should always be used whenever notes precede the selected notes, in order to preserve the performance exactly.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'Initial note separation becomes' setting</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The initial note separation is the musical distance between the first two selected notes. For example, if you select an entire performance which is mostly quarter notes, but the first two selected notes should be separated only by an 8th note, then set Initial note separation becomes to an 8th note.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">If the first few notes are all in a chord, then you should set the Initial note separation to be the separation between that chord and the next note or chord.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">If you have selected 'Use Sense Tempo Swing' from the Identify Beats Mode popup, then be careful how you set the initial note separation. Most of the time, you will want to set it to either a triplet 8th or triplet quarter note, depending on the rhythmic separation of the first two notes you will play. For an explanation why, see 'Sense Tempo Swing' and 'initial note separation' in the <u>Sense Tempo Settings</u></font> on-line help topic.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Choosing an Identify Beats Mode</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The Identify Beats Mode pop-up menu has three possible settings:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">1. All selected notes are on grid<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">2. Use Sense Tempo<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">3. Use Sense Tempo Swing<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">If you choose 'All selected notes are on grid', you are telling FreeStyle that every note you selected should be placed on a grid line. (Exception: the first two selected notes will be positioned according to the settings on the left side of the dialog and need not be on the grid.) The grid can be set to measure boundaries, beat boundaries (as determined by the meter changes in the music) or a fixed grid with a note duration that you specify. For example, if you are in 4/4 and the notation shows three quarter note triplets that you know should be quarter notes, select the three notes, set Grid is to beats, and click Do It to make FreeStyle re-transcribe the notes as straight quarter notes. <font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">If you choose 'Use Sense Tempo' or 'Use Sense Tempo Swing', then the Sense Tempo engine will evaluate all of the notes you selected and make its best guess as to how to notate the music and what the tempos should be. With these two options, the notes that you selected need not be all on the beat. But you should be careful not to select slow grace notes or notes that were played badly out of time with the rest of the performance. When you use either of these options, the way Sense Tempo processes the notes is controlled by the current settings in the Sense Tempo Settings dialog box. For the Use Sense Tempo Swing option, the duration you choose for the initial note separation is very important; see 'Sense Tempo Swing' and 'initial note separation' in the <u>Sense Tempo Settings</u></font> on-line help topic.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'Adjust beats after selected region' option</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Check this item if you are making a correction which could potentially affect how the rest of the music should be notated. You almost always want this option turned on. When it is turned on, then the manner in which later beats are adjusted is determined by the setting of the following radio buttons:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Use last adjusted tempo through end of section<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">or<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Sense tempo through end of section<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">These are the same options as described in 'Adjust all following beats, too' in the<u> Adjust Beats</u></font> on-line help topic.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Using Identify Beats with Select All</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The Identify Beats feature is actually pretty smart about dealing with multi-beat rests, chords, and several notes between beats. You can often get very good results just by selecting an entire performance and adjusting everything at one time. Just be sure not to use the All selected notes are on grid option (discussed above). Instead, use Sense Tempo or Sense Tempo Swing and be careful to set the Initial note separation becomes setting properly.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Adjust Beats<font size="1"> (1 of 2)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Adjust Beats palette is one of FreeStyle's three beat adjustment features. For a summary of them, see the <u>Beat Adjustment Overview</u></font> on-line help topic. <font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Adjust Beats palette can be used to correct the beats and barlines for a performance that was recorded with the metronome turned off.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">The Adjust Beats palette is used with the Graphic Editing view. To use it, switch to Graphic Editing and then choose Adjust Beats from the Song menu. A small palette appears, and blue dotted vertical lines also appear on the Graphic Editor. The blue lines indicate where FreeStyle currently thinks the beats are.<br>

<b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Adjust Beats Settings<font size="1"> (2 of 2)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Choosing a grid</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Use the Adjust pop-up menu in the Adjust Beats palette to display beat lines for measures, beats, or any fixed grid value in the graphic editor. It is often useful to set this to quarter notes, or 8th notes, but you might occasionally want to adjust a few notes to line up exactly on the triplet quarter note grid, for instance. You can also change the grid as you work. For example, you might want to start with measures and then use beats to tweak a measure that needs further adjustment. Or, you might have some triplets or other tuplet material in an otherwise duple piece.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Once you have chosen a grid value, you can correct the placement of beats by dragging a blue beat line to the beginning of a note. As with all of FreeStyle's beat adjustment operations, this will not change the performance of the music.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Snap to notes</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When the 'Snap to notes' option is checked, the beat line will snap to the start time of the closest note when you release the mouse. This is usually what you want because it allows you to hit the start time of notes exactly without having to know what the start times are. <font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Scrub while adjusting</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When the 'Scrub while adjusting' option is checked, you will be able to hear the notes play as you drag the beat line over them. Sometimes it is easier to identify notes by sound than by their graphic representation. <font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Adjust all following beats, too</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When the 'Adjust all following beats, too' option is not checked, FreeStyle will adjust the tempo map only in the beat areas immediately before and after the beat line you are dragging. This is the fastest adjustment mode, and it is useful for when you want to fix just a few notes in a measure without affecting the notation anywhere else. Use this mode when all the beat lines are in the right position except for the one you are dragging.<br>
</font>When the 'Adjust all following beats, too' check box is turned on, FreeStyle will adjust the tempo map for the beat line you are dragging and for all following beats. How it modifies the following beats depends on which of the following radio buttons you choose:<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">1. Use adjusted beat's tempo through end of section<br>
</font>2. Sense tempo through end of section <font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'use adjusted beat's tempo through end of section' option</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Use this option when you expect that the tempo change produced by the correction you are making will be the correct tempo for the rest of the performance -- or at least the next few bars. For example, if your quarter notes just got farther apart because you slowed down and are going to stay slowed down, then adjusting all following beats with this option will make ensuing notes line up closer to the beats.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">The 'sense tempo through end of section' option</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Use this option if the rest of your piece is not played at a constant tempo, or if you are making a correction to a tempo map that was recorded using Sense Tempo. When you use this option, the behavior of Sense Tempo as it processes the following beats will be governed by the current settings in the Sense Tempo Settings dialog box. In particular, make sure that the Notes will be played with swing option in the Sense Tempo Settings dialog box is correct for the material you are currently working on.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">What is Sense Tempo?</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature allows you to record your music without listening to a metronome click while FreeStyle detects the tempo you are playing and properly aligns its own beats and barlines with your performance. The result is a precisely captured performance of your music that lines up with FreeStyle's beats and barlines -- which also results in a readable transcription in the Notation view.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">How does FreeStyle do it? It splits what you play into a stream of recorded notes and a tempo map that matches the tempo changes in your performance. The tempo map is recorded with a high degree of precision, ensuring that what gets recorded sounds exactly like what you played.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">And because your performance is aligned with FreeStyle's beats and barlines, you enjoy all of the benefits of using the Notation View and all of FreeStyle's other features, such as Quantizing, that depend on a note's position within the measure.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">With Sense Tempo, you can play at a constant tempo, or you can play rubato, changing tempo as freely as you like as you play. The Sense Tempo Settings dialog lets you give FreeStyle an idea of how much or how little you'll change tempos as you play so that it can produce results that are as accurate as possible.<font size="3"><br>

If you're not playing swing and you know that most of your notes are going to be half notes, you may get better results if you set this to half notes even though the meter you are playing in is 4/4.

However, in order for Sense Tempo to establish an initial tempo you must tell it where your first note should go, and what the separation between the first two notes or chords should be. These two pieces of information together give Sense Tempo enough to go on without a metronome as an initial timing reference.

The Sense Tempo engine will then interpret your swing rhythms as being the first and third members of a triplet instead of dotted 8th followed by a sixteenth note, as shown below in Figure 64. But don't worry. You won't be flooded with triplets in the Notation view as long as you turn on (check) FreeStyle's Straighten Swing menu item in the Setup menu. It makes FreeStyle write swing notation as straight quarters, eighths and sixteenths, even though internally the notes have been interpreted using a triplet grid.<br>
</font>If you play a swing passage that sounds like:<font size="3"><br>

If you would like to use Sense Tempo Swing together with initial note separation as a means of getting started, most of the time you'll want to choose either a triplet 8th note or triplet quarter note as the initial note separation, depending on the rhythmic separation of the first two notes you will play. Why? This gets a little tricky, but here's a basic explanation. If the separation between the first two events would be written in straight time as a dotted eighth to a sixteenth, tell Sense Tempo that the initial note separation is a triplet quarter (which equals two triplet eighths), as shown below. If the separation between the first two events would be written in straight time as a sixteenth leading into a dotted eighth note (or quarter) as shown below, tell Sense Tempo that the initial note separation is a triplet 8th.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Be careful when editing tempo maps after Sense Tempo recording</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Whenever you draw tempo events into a tempo map, you are changing the performance of all parts that are sounding while that tempo map is in effect. If the tempo map was created as the result of a beat adjustment operation or Sense Tempo recording, do not try to edit it directly unless you are willing to hear a change in the performance of the music. If the notes are still not notating the way you want, use Identify Beats or Adjust Beats to correct them. When you use those features, FreeStyle will adjust the tempo map and the notes simultaneously in order to keep the performance of the notes exactly the same.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Real time transcription preference for Sense Tempo</font></b><br>
<font size="2">There is an option called 'Update notation while recording with Sense Tempo' in the Preferences command in the Edit menu. When this option is checked, notation will update in real time as you record with Sense Tempo. When it is not checked, Sense Tempo processing will not occur until you hit the stop or rewind buttons, or do some other action which would terminate recording. Turn this option on only if you have a fast computer. This setting is not recommended for 486 or Pentium computers below 100 MHz.<br>

</font></font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Tricks &amp; Tips...<font size="1"> (1 of 1)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">...for Sense Tempo and Beat Adjustment</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Q: I recorded a Take without listening to the metronome, and without Sense Tempo turned on. Is there a way I can process the notes with Sense Tempo after the fact?</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A: Yes, by using the Identify Beats dialog. Identify Beats is really just a manual interface for controlling FreeStyle's tempo sensing algorithm. If you want to process the notes just as if Sense Tempo had been turned on at the time they were recorded, do the following:<br>
</font>1. Select all the notes in the Take.<br>
2. Choose 'Identify Beats' from the Region menu.<br>
3. Specify where the first note or chord should be positioned, using the measure, beat and tick fields below 'First selected note becomes:'.<br>
4. Choose 'Stretch beat to first note' (unless you are at the beginning of the piece and want to move the first note or chord by more than a beat).<br>
5. Set 'Initial note separation becomes:' to the separation you wish to have between the first two selected notes or chords.<br>
6. Set the mode popup menu in the upper right of the Identify Beats dialog to 'Sense Tempo' (if the material was played in straight rhythm) or 'Sense Tempo Swing' (if the material was played with a swing rhythm).<br>
7. Un-check 'Adjust beats after selected region'.8. Click on the 'Do It' button.<br>
When you click 'Do It,' FreeStyle will process all of the selected notes and create a tempo map which will adjust the placement of beats in the Take. If you do not like the results, choose 'Undo' from the Edit menu and see the 'Sense Tempo Settings' topic about how to use the 'Sense Tempo Settings' dialog. Usually, however, it's faster to just use Identify Beats again to fix whatever errors were made as described below.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Q: I recorded a Take with Sense Tempo and the results were great for a while. But after a point the notation and tempo got all out of whack. How do I fix that?</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A: Sometimes FreeStyle's tempo sensing algorithm just makes a bad decision. This will happen more frequently when playing with swing, when playing grace notes, when playing sloppy triplets, or when changing tempos abruptly. Luckily, it's very easy to tell FreeStyle where it went wrong. Simply find the first point in the music where the separation between two notes or chords is not what it should be. You will be able to hear where the mistake is pretty easily if you turn the metronome on. Play the music back and listen for the point at which the metronome is completely not what you would expect. Then look at the notation for the music at that point. You will find that the separation between two notes somewhere is just wrong. For example, in 4/4 time FreeStyle may have decided that you sped up and played 3 quarter notes when in fact you intended to maintain a slower tempo and play triplet quarter notes. Once you have identified the earliest point at which the notation goes awry, do the following:<br>
</font>1. Select the last note which is notated properly and the first note which is notated improperly (i.e., the first two notes that have an improper separation).<br>
2. Choose 'Identify Beats' from the Region menu.<br>
3. Specify where the first note or chord should be positioned, using the measure, beat and tick fields below 'First selected note becomes:'.<br>
4. Choose 'Stretch beat to first note'.<br>
5. Set 'Initial note separation becomes:' to the separation you wish to have between the selected notes or chords.<br>
6. Set the mode popup menu in the upper right of the Identify Beats dialog to 'Sense Tempo' (if the following material was played in straight rhythm) or 'Sense Tempo Swing' (if the following material was played with a swing rhythm).<br>
7. Make sure there is a check mark in front of 'Adjust beats after selected region'.<br>
8. Select 'sense tempo through end of section'.<br>
9. Click on the 'Do It' button.<br>
FreeStyle will then correct its error and redo the Sense Tempo processing from that point through the end of the section. You can give it an even better chance of getting it right by selecting a few of the following notes which should be on the beat, or on some grid, and setting the mode popup in the upper right of the dialog to 'All selected notes are on grid.'<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Q: In the Identify Beats dialog, when would I want to choose 'All selected notes are on grid' instead of 'Use Sense Tempo' or 'Use Sense Tempo Swing?'</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A: Use 'All selected notes are on the grid' when you want to make sure that particular notes are aligned exactly on certain beats or grid points. This is especially useful for forcing groups of notes to be triplets. When you select some notes and do an Identify Beats operation with 'Use Sense Tempo' or 'Use Sense Tempo Swing,' you are letting FreeStyle decide which notes to use as anchor points for beat adjustments. In that case it won't make a beat adjustment for every single note you select Ń it will skip over some notes and use other notes as the basis for when a tempo change should start. In the triplet example just mentioned, this might result in FreeStyle deciding against recognizing the triplet.<br>
</font>Sometimes you can get better results by making those decisions yourself. To take command of the situation, select the notes that you feel are the best determiners of where the beats lie and choose 'All selected notes are on grid.' This setting really means 'All selected notes are on grid, except maybe for the first two.' The placement of the first two notes or chords is determined by your settings in the left hand side of the dialog, but all the rest of the selected notes will be forced to a position on the specified grid. When you use this technique, FreeStyle will know exactly how to adjust the beats in the area around the selected notes.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Q: How can I adjust the beats in a measure or two without affecting the notation and tempos in later measures?</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A: Often you will finish beat adjusting an entire section and then find a measure in the middle somewhere that you would like to fine-tune. In this case, you want to adjust beats in an isolated area, but not disturb any of the later beat adjustments that are correct through the end of the section. The easiest way to accomplish this is to view the music in the graphic editor, and then select 'Adjust Beats' from the Song menu. Make sure you un-check the option labelled 'Adjust all following beats, too.' Then follow the instructions for dragging beat lines in the &quot;Adjust Beats&quot; on-line help topic and you will be able to adjust beat positions without disturbing later notation.<br>
</font>You can also make this kind of adjustment in either the Notation view or the Graphic editing view by using the Identify Beats dialog. In order to accomplish this, you must perform a series of Identify Beats operations with the 'Adjust all following beats, too' option turned off. First, identify the first note in the bar that follows the bar you want to change. Double-click on it to see the note detail dialog, and make a note of its exact start time. We'll call this note the 'anchor' note. Then go back to the previous bar, select just the first two notes whose separation is incorrect and use Identify Beats to force the separation to be correct. Continue to choose pairs of notes to correct separations in the incorrect bar until the end of the bar is reached. Then make one final selection of notes, using your 'anchor' note as the second note in the selection. Carefully set the separation so that the anchor note gets positioned exactly as before. If you did each of the 'Identify Beats' operations with the 'Adjust all following beats, too' option turned off, FreeStyle will not have touched the tempo map beyond the last note selected. So once you get the anchor note back to the position it used to have, everything from that point on will notate as before.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Q: Can I record multiple Takes with 'Sense Tempo?'</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A: Yes! Simply choose 'New Take' from the Record menu, turn on Sense Tempo and record. FreeStyle remembers which tempo map is associated with each Sense Tempo Take. Whenever you choose a Take that was recorded with Sense Tempo, that Take's tempo map will become the current tempo map and all other players will follow the same tempo changes during playback.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Q: Can I 'conduct' a sequence by recording a Sense Tempo overdub?</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A: Yes! This is a neat trick made possible by the fact that FreeStyle remembers which tempo map was in effect at the time that each Take was recorded. When you use Sense Tempo, Identify Beats or Adjust Beats, FreeStyle modifies the notation only for those Takes which were recorded while the current tempo map was in effect.<br>
</font>To 'conduct' a sequence by recording a Sense Tempo overdub, do the following:<br>
1. First make sure that all of the existing Takes are beat-aligned to your satisfaction.<br>
2. This is probably the case if they were all recorded while listening to a metronome.<br>
3. Record-enable a player and choose 'New Take' from the Record menu.<br>
4. Click on the solo button for the record-enabled player.Since tempo adjustment does not happen completely in real time, it would be impossible to play along with the other parts while changing tempo.<br>
5. Choose 'Sense Tempo' or 'Sense Tempo Swing' from the record mode popup menu in the control palette.<br>
6. Click the Play button or press the space bar to begin recording.<br>
7. Click the Stop button or press the space bar again to stop when you are done recording.<br>
8. Un-click the solo button for the record-enabled player.<br>
When you are done recording, FreeStyle will adjust beats only for the notes of your newly recorded Take. The old Takes will notate exactly as they did before. However, when you play the music back, all players will follow the tempo changes generated by the Take you just recorded!<br>
You can also use FreeStyle's numerous tempo control features to add tempo changes Ń or a rubato feel Ń to a FreeStyle document, too. For example, you can record the tempo slider in the Control palette as you listen to your music to add tempo nuances. These features are covered in detail in the on-line help topic called 'Tempo'.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Q: No matter what I do, I can't get the notation to change for a given Take when I use Identify Beats or Adjust Beats. What's wrong?</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A: It's possible that the current tempo map is not the tempo map that was in effect when the Take in question was recorded. A beat adjustment operation in FreeStyle will have no effect on the notation for Takes which were recorded while some other tempo map was in effect. You can choose which tempo map is active by selecting it in the 'Tempo source' menu inside the Ensemble palette (you may have to expand the Ensemble palette in order to see this menu). If a Take was not recorded using Sense Tempo, then it was most likely recorded while 'Section Map, Take 1' was the tempo source.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Q: Can I use Sense Tempo while recording more music onto the end of a Take?</font></b><br>
<font size="2">A: Yes! Simply start recording with Sense Tempo at any point after the last note in the take. When you are finished, FreeStyle will adjust the beats only for the new notes that you recorded, leaving the beginning of the Take untouched.<font size="3"><br>

</font></font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Inhibiting Pan to preserve stereo sounds<font size="1"> (1 of 1)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">The problem</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Some MIDI instruments (certain variations of Proteus series from E-mu Systems, Alesis keyboards, and others) do not handle pan messages in a standard fashion when dealing with stereo sounds that are made of two samples, (one panned left and the other right). But if you send a MIDI pan message to one of these devices, it responds by panning both samples in the stereo pair to the value of the MIDI pan event. So if you send a pan message with a value of 64 (center), both samples get panned to the center, resulting in a mono sound. Once this situation occurs, there is usually no way to correct the pan settings via further MIDI messages. Usually the only way to restore the stereo panning is to do so via the front panel controls on the device itself.<br>
</font>This can be a problem because FreeStyle sends pan messages all the time. When you choose a sound for a player, FreeStyle sends pan data to the player. When you press play, FreeStyle sends pan data to each player to ensure that they begin with the correct pan setting in the Ensemble palette. The result is that if you have a MIDI instrument that handles stereo sounds in the manner described above, you'll never actually hear them in stereo when using FreeStyle.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">The solution</font></b><br>
<font size="2">You can prevent FreeStyle from automatically sending pan data to a MIDI device by doing the following things:<br>
</font>1. Choose Studio Setup from the Setup menu, expand the details for the device in question, and check the 'Pan disrupts stereo' device property as shown below.<br>
<img data="bm75.jpg" title="bm75.jpg"><br>
2. Back in FreeStyle, lock the MIDI channel of any player that uses a stereo sound from that MIDI instrument. Choose a MIDI channel as high as possible to avoid channels that may have already received a pan message.<br>
3. For information about locking players, see <u>Locking Player MIDI Channels</u>. Don't change the pan setting for the player in the Ensemble palette, and don't draw any pan events for the player in the Controller view.<br>
Remember, as soon as a MIDI pan message is sent to the instrument, the problem will occur. Steps 1 and 2 above will prevent FreeStyle from sending pan events automatically to the device, but you must also not send any manually by any of the methods already discussed.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">FreeStyle can either follow or generate standard MIDI beat clocks.

</font>Implementations of MIDI sync have evolved over the years. As a result, not all devices transmit and send MIDI clock signals in the same way. FreeStyle provides several options for maximum synchronization compatibility with your master device. The default settings reflect the most commonly used MIDI standards. It is best to leave them set this way unless you experience problems when synchronizing.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Beat clock ratio</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Some manufacturers have begun to make devices which send 24 clock signals per beat (one click of the device's metronome) instead of the standard 24 clocks per quarter note. This new method is very useful when there are meters which do not use the quarter note as the beat unit: 3/8, 5/16, etc. In 6/8, for example, there might be a metronome click every three eighth notes; in 4/1, the metronome would click once every whole note. If you were using a less common meter such as 5/32 or 3/16 + 4/16, using the quarter note as the timing base would not be very useful. Instead, use the 24 clocks per metronome click option.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">When First clock is time 1 is checked, FreeStyle interprets the first MIDI clock signal it receives as the second timing clock of the sequence, 1/24th of a beat after the beginning. Devices manufactured recently send the first clock signal (time 0) after the start command for the sequence. Some earlier devices assume the start command to be the first clock signal. The first clock signal they send would be 1/24th of a beat after the beginning. If you are using one of these devices, you should check this option.<br>
</font>Since manufacturers rarely explain this aspect in their documentation, you may not know if your device behaves this way. The best way to find out is to experiment: set the metronome to the slowest possible tempo, play both devices (with FreeStyle as slave) and listen for discrepancies in attacks and beat alignment. The difference of 1/24th of a beat is very audible at a slow tempo. If FreeStyle seems slightly behind the master device, try checking this option.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">What are RPN and NRPN Messages?</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">RPN (Registered Parameter Number) and NRPN (Non Registered Parameter Number) messages provide a way to extend the MIDI specification by introducing new MIDI messages that were not envisioned at the time the specification was written. These messages may or may not be supported by a given synthesizer; only a few are detailed in the current official MIDI specification, and many are limited to specific brands (or even models) of synthesizer. Check your synthesizer's manual to see which RPN and NRPN messages are supported.<br>
</font>In essence, RPN and NRPN messages are simply MIDI controller messages that contain both information about what should be changed, and how it should be changed. For instance, when a conforming synthesizer receives RPN message 0 with a value of 110, it changes its pitch bend sensitivity (specified by the message number of 0) to the value specified in the message (110).<br>
The MIDI 1.0 Specification lists three RPN (Registered Parameter Number) messages; these message types have been registered with the MIDI Manufacturers Association, and many synthesizer manufacturers agree to implement their synthesizers' responses to these messages.<br>
<img data="bm131.jpg" title="bm131.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">In addition, manufacturers may build their instruments to respond to various messages not listed in the MIDI 1.0 Specification. These NRPN (Non-Registered Parameter Number) messages are specific to each synthesizer manufacturer, and may only be implemented for a particular model of synthesizer.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">RPN and NRPN Messages in FreeStyle</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle allows you to enter RPN and NRPN messages in the Continuous Data pane. Select RPN or NRPN from the message type popup at the bottom of the pane, and use the flag tool to enter individual events. Click the Edit button in the event flag to bring up the RPN/NRPN Event Edit window.<br>
</font><img data="bm130.jpg" title="bm130.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">For RPN messages (and some NRPN messages on certain synthesizers) a pop-up window will let you select the message by name. You can also enter the parameter number directly in the Parameter Number edit field.<br>
</font>NOTE: All numerical values in the RPN and NRPN editors are expressed in hexadecimal form.<br>
If you directly enter a number (in hex) for a RPN or NRPN message that FreeStyle has information about, the name of the message will be displayed in the popup; if FreeStyle has no information about the message, the pop-up will display Other. You can then enter values for the high and low bytes of the message as described in your synthesizer's manual.<br>
You can also edit RPN and NRPN messages by double-clicking on them in the event list. This will also bring up the RPN/NRPN Event Edit window.<br>
FreeStyle is also capable of recording RPN and NRPN messages from synthesizers that send such messages.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Overview</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle allows you to record, playback, and edit MIDI System Exclusive messages. Common types of System Exclusive messages include patch dumps, preset selections, editing parameters, etc. FreeStyle can thus store patches, samples, and other important information from your MIDI equipment in system exclusive form. Patches, edit parameters, and other special commands can be incorporated into your FreeStyle compositions, greatly expanding the resources of your MIDI sound modules.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">System Exclusive<font size="1"> (2 of 12)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Basics</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">System Exclusive messages are a special type of MIDI data. A System Exclusive message consists of a header, body, and an 'end of message' byte. (A byte is a unit of digital information, roughly equivalent to a single character or letter.)<br>
</font>The header labels the following data as System Exclusive information, and includes a code identifying the manufacturer of the equipment transmitting the data.<br>
The body of the message contains the actual data being sent. This data may take any form the manufacturer desires. While there are some standards for the format of System Exclusive information, for the most part a System Exclusive message is only understood by the type of equipment that generated it. As a result, recording a patch dump from one synthesizer and sending it to another will generally not produce useful results. FreeStyle does not respond to or interpret System Exclusive data; any analysis or editing of the body of the message is your responsibility.<br>
Finally, the end of message byte, F7, marks the end of the System Exclusive data, and signals FreeStyle to interpret subsequent information as standard MIDI data.<br>
As defined in the MIDI specification, a System Exclusive message must begin and end with an F0 and F7 byte, respectively. In addition, only hexadecimal values of 7F (127 in base ten) or less are allowed. When you click the OK button after inserting or editing the contents of a System Exclusive event, FreeStyle will highlight any bytes that violate the conditions just stated, and it will alert you about what's wrong.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Recording and Playing System Exclusive Messages</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">System Exclusive messages are recorded and played back like any other MIDI data. These messages vary in size; information for a bank of patches, for instance, may be 100K or more. No matter how long a message is, it is treated as a single event by FreeStyle. Note that a long System Exclusive message can briefly halt recording or playback as FreeStyle processes the data; it is best to place larger System Exclusive events like patch or bank dumps in separate sections, or at the start of a section in measure zero (the pickup bar) before the actual music begins.<br>
</font>Because System Exclusive messages have no channel assignment, they are sent to every MIDI device connected to the computer's serial port (either directly or via a MIDI interface). If you have several devices of the same model or brand connected to the same port, they may all respond to a message sent to or from just one of them. Conversely, some manufacturers encode channel assignments into the body of the System Exclusive message. FreeStyle is unable to access or rechannelize such an assignment.<br>
For example, if the playback assignment for a player is channel 1, but a System Exclusive message full of patches intended for that synth includes an encoded assignment to channel 16, the synth won't receive the patches.<br>
Find out if any of your equipment encodes channel assignments in its System Exclusive messages, and be careful about changing channel assignments on equipment to which you intend to send System Exclusive. If you encounter difficulty when working with System Exclusive data, try connecting the MIDI device directly to your MIDI interface, to prevent interaction with other equipment.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Viewing &amp; Editing System Exclusive Data</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">System Exclusive data can be viewed and edited in the Controller pane of the Graphic Editing window or in the Event List window (with All Events or System Exclusive chosen in the Show menu). In the Event List, a System Exclusive message will consist of the label Sysex and as much data as can fit on one line.<br>
</font><img data="bm178.jpg" title="bm178.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">To see the entire message, double-click on the System Exclusive event. A window appears:<br>
</font><img data="bm177.jpg" title="bm177.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The window is divided into a top and bottom portion. The bottom portion displays the system exclusive data contained in the event. The top portion is used to type in and transmit short system exclusive "request" messages, which can be sent to a synthesizer that requires a short system exclusive bulk dump request message to initiate a bulk dump to be recorded into the lower portion of the window.<br>
</font>The System Exclusive data is displayed in hexadecimal (base 16) numbering. Each pair of hexadecimal digits, which include the numerals 0-9 and the letters A-F, represents a byte of data. Each line contains eight pairs of digits. To the left of each line of data is a two-digit hexadecimal number indicating the position of the first byte of data in that row. The first row starts at position 00, the next at 08, the third at 10 (this is 16 in hexadecimal), and so forth.<br>
The length of the System Exclusive message is displayed at the lower left. This is the number of bytes of data in the message.<br>
The scroll bars let you scroll through long messages. When you press the OK button, FreeStyle checks the changes you have made to the data and will scroll to and highlight any byte that does not conform to the MIDI specification. After confirming your changes, FreeStyle closes the window. Pressing the Cancel button closes the window without making any changes to the data.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Hints &amp; Tips</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Most synthesizers and many other MIDI devices allow you to dump patch settings as System Exclusive messages. You can use FreeStyle to store and organize these messages, creating a library of patches and presets. Store each patch or bank of patches as a separate section in one or more files. This way you can use the section name to label your presets. To restore a patch or bank, view the desired section and play it. However, if you would like a much more intuitive and powerful means to do this, check out Mark of the Unicorn's Unisyn software, a universal editor librarian package that supports hundreds of current and vintage MIDI gear.<br>
</font>You can paste System Exclusive dumps of sounds and settings at the start of a section. This lets you use patches or settings that can't fit into your MIDI devices' preset storage, and ensures that the right sounds are loaded for the song. Use the standard Copy and Paste commands to place the system exclusive events at the start of the sequence. It is best to leave a measure or two of space after the system exclusive messages and the start of the music, to allow your equipment to process the data.<br>
Some manufacturers allow you to edit patch parameters over MIDI, using short system exclusive messages. This can add a great deal of expression to a sequence. For example, the attack of a filter envelope could be controlled with system exclusive and controller data, creating different bowing effects for a violin patch.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">System Exclusive<font size="1"> (12 of 12)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Be Careful</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">System exclusive data is not associated with a channel, as defined in the MIDI specification. System exclusive data is merely sent to the serial port you have specified for playback; no channel number can be attached. Some manufacturers have decided to include a channel number in some of their system exclusive messages. This number cannot be changed. Therefore, even if data is being sent to channel 3, for example, system exclusive messages contained in that data might be sent to a channel other than 3.<br>
</font>System exclusive data is complex, and varies greatly from device to device. If you are uncertain about your equipment's system exclusive implementation, you should be very careful in using or editing system exclusive data. Most of the time, turning a piece of equipment off and then on again will clear any strange behavior caused by incorrect system exclusive data; however, incorrect use of system exclusive data could permanently erase presets from a synthesizer or other MIDI device.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Set the tempo and metronome</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Recording with the metronome helps ensure that FreeStyle's measures and beats properly match what you play -- although you don't have to listen to the metronome to accomplish this. FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature allows you to record without the metronome while FreeStyle follows the tempo you play. However, recording with the metronome sometimes produces better transcription.<br>
</font>So before recording with the metronome, drag the tempo slider in the Control palette to the desired tempo. Afterwards, you can raise or lower the tempo without affecting the pitch of the music. This is a great technique for playing in music accurately: record it slow and then play it back at normal speed. To set up a metronome, choose <u>Metronome</u> from the Setup menu.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">You are now ready to record a Take. To see which player you will be recording into, look at the record buttons to the left of the player names in the ensemble window. Get ready to play and then click the rewind, record and play buttons in the Control Palette. If Wait For Note is checked, FreeStyle will endlessly cycle the first bar until you play your first note. If you don't want it to do so, uncheck the Wait For Note command in the Record menu.<br>
</font>Play music for as long as you like into the section. Notice the following things happen as you record:<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&gt;If you play past the end of the section, the section boundary moves as needed to automatically adjust the length of the section.<br>

Notes appear on the screen in the notation or graphic editing view immediately as you play them.<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you have the Auto Loop Record feature turned on, FreeStyle automatically sets up the record loop over the region of music you just played -- after you stop playing for 2 bars.<br>

Discard everything you have recorded into a take (since the last time you used the &quot;Keep Recording&quot; command) by choosing Undo Record from the Edit menu.<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Do A/B listening tests between takes to decide which one you like best. Use the up and down arrow keys, type single digit take numbers, or choose takes with the take pop-up in the ensemble window.<br>

Record again into the same take to add more material to the take (see <u>Keep Recording and Drum Parts</u>).<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Keep Recording &amp; drum parts</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Keep Recording command in the Record menu is a way of protecting what you have recorded so far so the &quot;Undo Recording&quot; command in the Edit menu won't erase it.<br>
</font>This command is especially useful when recording drum parts. Most of the time, you'll record each drum (e.g. kick, snare, hi hat) into a single take for a single player named Drums (or a similar name). But what should you do if you've recorded the kick and snare, and you like what you've got so far, but then you make a mistake when adding the hi hat? If you choose Undo Recording, you'll lose the kick and snare also. If you choose New Take, the kick and snare will disappear.<br>
This is where the Keep Recording command helps: it causes everything you've recorded into the take so far to be "kept" when you use Undo. So in our current example, if you recorded kick and snare, and you like what you have so far, you choose Keep Recording (from the Record menu) before you add anything else. Then, if you make a mistake when adding the hi hat, you can use Undo Recording to discard the hi hat without losing the kick and snare. <font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note: Keep Recording is not a substitute for saving your file! Keep Recording will protect your notes from Undo Recording, but new notes are never actually saved to the file until you use Save or Save As in the File menu.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">After you have recorded several sections, you are ready to make a song. Choose "New Song" from the song menu and enter the name "My Song." The FreeStyle Arrangement window will appear. On the left is a list of all of your sections -- if you have been following this tutorial, you'll only have two of them. Type the letters "a-b-a-b" in succession to quickly place your first two sections onto the arrangement grid. Or, if you prefer you can drag each section from the list on the left to a position on the grid to the right. For now make sure you put sections in the top row of the grid, which is the "primary song structure row."<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Record into the song</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">In FreeStyle you can also record directly into a song arrangement. There are two different ways you can do this:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Single section recording within the context of a song<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Follow Song" recording into multiple sections<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">First make sure that the graphic editing/notation window is displaying the song "My Song." To do this, click on the "View:" popup menu in the upper left corner of the window and choose "My Song." Section names are listed first in this popup, followed by a divider line, then all of the song names.<br>
</font><img data="bm54.jpg" title="bm54.jpg"><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Another way to show your song in the graphic editing/notation window is to click on the arrangement window, or choose "Arrangement Window" from the Windows menu.<br>
<p><hr><p>
				
	
</font></font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Tutorial: recording into a song<font size="1"> (3 of 4)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Single-section recording within a song</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">In the arrangement window, click on one of the "Verse" sections that you placed on the arrangement grid. A red bar will appear across the top of the section to indicate that the section is record-enabled. Recording can now happen only within the bounds of the "Verse" -- notes that you play while the wiper is over any other section will not be recorded. However, each section in FreeStyle has a pickup bar and an overhang bar that overlap neighboring sections in the arrangement. Therefore, notes can actually be recorded 1 bar before what you think of as the start of the "Verse", and up to 1 bar following what you think of as the end of the "Verse." Notes recorded in the pickup or overhang measures of a section nonetheless are part of that section, not part of neighboring sections in the arrangement. To see this in action, let's record something new. Choose "New Take" from the Record menu. Look in the Record menu and make sure that "Follow Song" is not checked. Next, make sure that the record button is on in the control palette, then click on the rewind and play buttons. Start playing something a beat or so before the wiper gets to bar 1, and continue playing past the end of the first "Verse." You will notice that notes appear in the graphic editing view as you play until one bar past the end of the record-enabled section. Then the rest of your notes are ignored until the time wiper reaches the next instance of "Verse" in your arrangement.<br>
</font><img data="bm154.jpg" title="bm154.jpg"><br>
Now choose &quot;Verse&quot; from the &quot;View:&quot; popup menu in the upper left corner of the graphic editing view. You will clearly see that some of your notes fell in the pickup and overhang bars of the Verse section, but they are nonetheless part of the Verse.<br>
<img data="bm155.jpg" title="bm155.jpg"><br>
If you want to make a linear recording that plays back at the same time as your &quot;Verse&quot; and &quot;Chorus&quot; sections, you can do the following. First, type Alt-W-2 to bring the Arrangement window to the front again. Choose &quot;New Section&quot; from the Song menu. Name the section &quot;Linear.&quot; The name &quot;Linear&quot; appears at the bottom of the sections list on the left side of the arrangement window. Drag the &quot;Linear&quot; section out onto the second row of the arrangement window starting at bar 1.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2"><img data="bm156.jpg" title="bm156.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The "Linear" section now has a red bar over it, indicating that it has become the record-enabled section. Click the rewind and play buttons, and begin recording notes into this section. When you reach the end of the section, it will simply grow to the right as you keep playing. The graphic editing window will show the new notes that you have recorded, overlapping notes that are simultaneously playing in the Verse and Chorus sections. The linear section can grow to accommodate the notes you play because there are no other sections in the way to the right of it on row 2. In the previous example when we were recording into the "Verse" section it didn't grow because the "Chorus" section was immediately following it in row 1.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">&quot;Follow Song&quot; recording</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Suppose you have a bunch of sections lined up end to end in the top row of the arrangement grid, and you want to record Clarinet takes for each section while you play the entire song. To do this, select "Follow Song" in the Record menu. When this feature is turned on, the record-enabled section will move to the next section in the top row of the arrangement grid as each section is encountered, as you play. Note, however, that in this case you are not recording a single take like you did when you recorded into the separate "Linear" section. In this case your notes go into the current take selected in each section, in turn, as it is encountered.<br>
</font>Type Alt-W-2 to bring the Arrangement window to the front again. The View popup menu in the graphic editing/notation window shows "My Song." Make sure that "Follow Song" is checked in the Record menu and that the record button is on in the control palette. Just to give us something new to record, let's add a player to the ensemble. Choose "Add Player" from the Setup menu and choose "Clarinet" from the Player Library Entry drop-down list, then click OK. You will see that a Clarinet player has been added in the ensemble palette, and that the Clarinet player is record-enabled. Now click the rewind and play buttons and play Clarinet notes while the first two "Verse" and "Chorus" <b>section</b>s play. This time, when the wiper is over the body of the first Verse section, the notes will go into the Verse and when the wiper is over the body of the first Chorus section, the notes will go into the Chorus. You may notice that as the wiper reaches the end of the Verse section and enters the Chorus section, the red bar in the arrangement window moves from the Verse to the Chorus, indicating that the record-enabled section has automatically changed for you. When the wiper reaches the beginning of the second Verse section, you will hear the Clarinet notes that you recorded in your pass over the first Verse section. Any new Clarinet notes that you play will be overdubbed on top of the existing notes in the Verse. This is because the section "Verse" plays back in exactly the same way wherever it appears in your arrangement. <br>
If you want to make a Verse2 section that can be modified independently from the Verse section, do the following: Click on the second Verse section in the arrangement grid to select it and hit the delete key. Next, click once on the name "Verse" in the section list on the left side of the arrangement window (not on the first Verse section instance that is placed on the arrangement grid). Choose "Duplicate Section" from the Song menu. A section called "Verse Copy" appears at the bottom of the section list. Double-click on "Verse Copy" and type "Verse2" to rename it -- then hit the enter key. Drag out "Verse2" and position it in the hole on row 1 where the second instance of "Verse" used to be. Now you can make changes to Verse2 in your arrangement which will not affect the "Verse" section.<br>
Once you have created a song you are not limited to recording into the song as a whole. You can double click on any section instance in the arrangement grid to view that section in isolation. Then you can record into the section as described earlier in this tutorial and your changes will affect all songs that use the section.<br>

</font>You can also position the Graphic Editing (or Notation Editing) window next to the event list to see the notes entered in graphical or notational form as well. In fact, once you get the step record settings the way you want, you don't even need to have the Event List as the front-most window.<br>
Next, you need to choose a player to record into as usual by clicking its record button in the Ensemble palette. In this tutorial, you'll be step-recording notes from your MIDI keyboard, so be sure to click the Record button in the Control Palette as well. It's also a good idea to choose All Events from the Show menu, so you can see anything you enter.<br>
Finally, be sure to position the playback wiper at the location where you would like to begin inserting notes. For this tutorial, start at 1|1|0.<br>

</font></font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Choose a Step Size.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Step Size determines the amount of time between consecutive notes or chords that you enter. Step Size also determines the duration of the notes, but it is important for you to realize that the duration doesn't necessarily have to match the step size. For example, you might want to enter staccato quarter notes, where the step size is 960 ticks but their duration is 25% of the step size (240 ticks). For now, in this tutorial, we'll enter quarter notes by choosing a step size of one quarter note. In this case, let's make the duration 100% of the step size in the Duration box below the Insert menu. So choose a quarter note from the Step Size menu and make sure it says "+ 0 ticks; 960 ticks per" next to the menu. (FreeStyle also gives you the ability to choose the step size and insert the note (or step) in one operation by pressing the F keys (F1, F2, F3, etc.) across the top of your computer keyboard.

Also uncheck the As Played check box for now.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Inserting chords</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Now let's try another method of entering notes with the keyboard.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make sure the Insert from MIDI Keyboard option is checked.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make sure that the record button is pressed.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">To step-record notes from your MIDI keyboard, the record button in the main control palette must be depressed.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hold down two more notes to add to the original chord.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Notice that as you hold them down, they appear on-screen in the Event List and Notation (or graphic) editing window. But they aren't inserted yet, so if you take your hand off your MIDI keyboard, they will disappear. You can experiment with any pitches you like until you have the ones you want.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While holding down the desired keys, click the Step button (or press the NUM LOCK key on the keypad).</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">This does two things: it inserts the notes and moves the Insert Time ahead by one step - in this case, one quarter note.<font size="3"><br>

For a rest of any other duration, choose the desired duration from the Step Size menu and then click the Step button. For now, let's try adding a quarter note rest. Simply click the Step button. The counter in the Control Palette should now read 1|3|0, and if you are in the notation window, the wiper should now be past beat 2.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Inserting notes from your MIDI keyboard</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Now let's try inserting four eighth notes in a row directly from your MIDI keyboard.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make sure that the Advance One Step on Insert option is turned on.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When checked, this option makes FreeStyle advance by one step as you insert each note or chord, regardless of whether you insert it by clicking the Insert button or by playing on your MIDI keyboard.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Check to make sure that the record button is pressed in the Control palette.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The record button has to be pressed when step recording from your MIDI instrument.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make the Event List the front-most window, and then choose an eighth note step size using your computer's extended keypad.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When the Event List is the front-most window, the keys on your computer keyboard's extended keypad let you choose the step size, too. To choose an eighth note step duration, press the 8 key. Other keys are as follows: 1 = whole note, 2 = half note, 4 = quarter note, 6 = sixteenth note, and the decimal key toggles the current duration between dotted and undotted. The 3 key toggles a triplet duration. Try experimenting as much as you'd like. Just press the keys and watch the Step Size menu change. Click <u>here</u></font> for a diagram of these keypad assignments.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font size="1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Play one note on your keyboard, making sure to tap the key fairly hard to make sure that it has a high enough velocity to appear in the Notation window.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Notice that an eighth note appears in FreeStyle and - as soon as you release the key - FreeStyle moves ahead by one step. This is due to the Advance One Step on Insert option.<br>

</font><b><font size="1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now play three more eighth notes in a similar fashion, taking as much time as you'd like between each one.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Notice that this mode of entering notes is great for flying in notes quickly. As soon as you finish playing each note, it gets entered. The same technique can be used to enter chords. And you can change the step size (and note duration) at any time while you are inserting in this fashion.<br>
</font>NOTE: If you would like to experiment with a note or chord before entering it, but the Advance One Step on Insert option is enabled, you can temporarily override it by holding down the control key. Just hold down the control key for as long as you would like to experiment. Then, release it when you would like to start inserting notes again.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Tutorial: Step Recording<font size="1"> (19 of 21)</font></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Inserting notes or chords in the middle of existing music</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle lets you step record notes or chords in the middle of existing music. One of two things can happen when you do this: either the existing notes will stay right where they are (and the new notes get merged in with them), or all existing notes after the notes being inserted will get shifted later in time to make space for the new notes.<br>
</font>If you want to leave the existing notes where they are and merge the new notes with them, just place the playback wiper (insert time) where you want, and step enter your new material using any of the methods already described in this tutorial.<br>
If you want to insert new material and shift everything after it later in time to make space for the new material, FreeStyle offers a different technique that involves holding down the ALT key while inserting the note. As a final example in our tutorial, let's practice this new ALT-key insertion technique. We'll practice with notes, but keep in mind that it also works for inserting other types of MIDI data, too.<br>
To insert notes and simultaneously shift everything after them later in time:<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Event List window, click on the note (or event) immediately preceding the point at which you want to insert new material.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">For the purposes of this demonstration, let's choose the last note of the first chord we entered. If you've entered exactly the same notes as shown in this tutorial, it will be either the A2 or the E3 in the chord on the downbeat of measure 1 as shown below. This step helps determine where the new material will be inserted - but not entirely. You'll also need to set the step size as explained in the next step.<br>
</font><img data="bm85.jpg" title="bm85.jpg"><br>
Choose a half note step size.<br>
The step size determines two things: 1) the duration of the note being inserted, and 2) the location where it will be inserted. In our current example, the new note being inserted will be a half note inserted on beat 3, which is a half-notes' worth of time after our currently selected note on the first beat.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font size="1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hold down the ALT key, and while holding it down, play a Bb2 (or any other note) on your MIDI keyboard.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The B-flat half note gets inserted on beat 3, and the four eighth notes get shifted down by a half note, which moves them into measure 2 as shown below. You could also insert the half note by holding down the ALT key while pressing the Enter key or while clicking on the Insert button.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Step recording in a song</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">In general, you'll find it a lot easier to use this ALT key insertion technique when viewing a section of music, rather than a song. As you can imagine, this technique can actually change the length of the section of music in which you are inserting the new material, since everything else is moving later in time to make room for it. If you try to use this technique when viewing a song, it can affect how much sections overlap while you are inserting the new music. As a result, your music may temporarily look a bit unusual when viewing the song - until you have a chance to rearrange the sections in the song to accommodate their new length. To avoid this temporary confusion, just view the section you want to insert in by itself.<br>

</font><font size="2">FreeStyle only reads "Format 1" Standard MIDI files. <br>
</font>When opening a standard MIDI file, you are given a chance to map each track in the file to any player template in your Player Library as shown below. Choose a player template for each track from the pop-up menu.<br>
FreeStyle maps each track inside the SMF into a Player. Because of this, do not use tracks that contain events for different channels. If you have tracks like this, pull them apart so that each track only has events for a single channel.<br>
FreeStyle does not support program changes in the middle of a track. FreeStyle will use the first program change it sees in a track as the player's sound, but will ignore subsequent program changes.<br>
Since FreeStyle currently only supports one global tempo, it will use the first tempo event it sees as the global tempo, and ignore subsequent tempo changes. This also applies to time signature changes.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Import into Section</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle lets you import Standard MIDI files into Sections in a Document. This is especially useful for transferring sequences from other sequencers into FreeStyle. Selecting Import into section displays a standard open file dialog.<br>
</font>FreeStyle then lets you match the tracks in the Standard MIDI File with the Players in your Document. Unlike opening a Standard MIDI File from scratch, when you import into an existing document you have the option of either assigning a track to an existing player, or of creating a player from a player template. The standard MIDI file will appear as a new section in the current document.<br>
If you are having trouble importing complex sequences: Many sequencers let you work with "sections", "chunks" or "sub-sequences". The Standard MIDI File format has no provision for storing multiple sections within a single file. The answer is to save multiple files, one for each section in your sequence. FreeStyle lets you import all of these SMFs at once using the "Import into section" feature.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Close</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Close command closes the currently open window. If several windows are open, it closes the window that is currently in front. Closing a document's main window (the window containing the graphic editing and notation views) also closes the document. If the document you want to close is not in front, click on its main window.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Save</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When you first create a new FreeStyle document or open an existing one from disk, the document is stored into the computer's temporary Random Access Memory (RAM) as you work. Changes you make to the document occur in the temporary version in RAM. The Save command writes the current state of your document to disk to store it permanently, even after you quit FreeStyle and switch off the computer. If you quit FreeStyle without saving, or if the computer is suddenly interrupted before you have a chance to save the document, all changes you have made to it since you last saved are lost forever. It is therefore important to save very often to avoid losing your work.<br>
</font>If you have previously saved a document, the current state replaces last saved version. If you are saving a document for the first time, a dialog box appears to ask you to name it. This dialog box is identical to the Save As dialog box explained in the next topic.<br>
Save frequently--every time you make a change that you like. Doing so prevents you from losing work should FreeStyle or the computer be interrupted.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">File Menu</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Save As</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Save As command is what you use the very first time you save a new document. Save As lets you name the document and choose where you want to store it on your hard disk. Save As also lets you save the currently open document on disk under a different name, preserving the last-saved version of the original document. Save As is useful when you would like to make changes to a document and save them, but you still want to preserve the original document. In this case, the Save command would not be the right command to use because it would replace the original document with the newly modified document, thus erasing the original document. Instead, Save As creates a new document on disk with the changes in it, and the original document remains unmodified under its original name.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Save As file formats</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The Save As command lets you save a file in several different formats:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">FreeStyle</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle is the standard FreeStyle file format. Use this format to save your FreeStyle files.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Stationery</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When the Stationery option is selected, the file is saved as a Stationery file, which acts much like a stationery "pad". When you use a stationery pad, you "tear off" a blank sheet of paper to work with and leave behind the original pad. Stationery documents on the computer work much the same way. Stationery files can be opened, but the computer will prevent you from modifying the original stationery pad file by making you Save As when you attempt to save the file. This option is great for preserving files that you do not want to modify and that you use regularly as a "template" from which to build new files. When saving as Stationery, everything in the file gets saved except notes and controllers. Saved items include players, sections, and songs.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">S.S. (Song Structure) Stationery</font></b><br>
<font size="2">This option is identical to the Stationery option (see the previous paragraph) with the following exception. Only songs and sections are preserved in the file; players are not. When you first open a new file using a Song Structure Stationery file, FreeStyle asks you to choose an ensemble. This is a convenient way to create song structures that you frequently use, such as a pop song structure with Intro, Chorus, Verse, Bridge, etc. and choose any type of ensemble you want to fill the sections. This feature combines convenience with flexibility: you have quick access to a customized song structure and you get to choose any ensemble to work with.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Standard MIDI File</font></b><br>
<font size="2">This option saves the section or song currently displayed in the Graphic Editing window (shown in the View pop-up menu) as a standard MIDI file on disk. Music saved in this file format can be opened with any music program that also reads and writes Standard MIDI Files--even programs that run on other types of computers. Each player is saved as a track, and only the current take for each player is included; other takes are not.<br>
</font>Be sure to choose the desired section or song in the View pop-up menu in the Graphic Editing window as shown below before you choose Save As from the File menu. Also be sure that the current takes for each player are the ones you want to include. Basically, what you hear when you play is what will be included in the Standard MIDI File.<br>
When saving as a Standard MIDI File, only the song or section displayed here is included in the file, so be sure to select the desired item before saving.<br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Save a Copy As</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Save a Copy As does the same thing as Save As (see <u>Save As</u></font>) with the following difference: after using Save As, the newly created document stays on the screen. After using Save a Copy As, the original document remains on the screen.<font size="3"><br>

This command does the same thing as choosing Close, answering "No" to save changes, and then re-opening the same file. Revert to Saved is useful for discarding all changes you have made to a document since you last saved it.<font size="3"><br>

This ties them together into one note. The Tie Notes command ties the notes in the sense of their musical meaning, but they may not actually be notated with a tie in FreeStyle's notation display. For example, the resulting note may just be a whole note.<font size="3"><br>

Beat Adjustment is when you tell FreeStyle where the beats are in a musical performance that for some reason does not match FreeStyle's beats and barlines. This situation would arise, for example, if you turned off FreeStyle's metronome and then recorded a piece of music without FreeStyle's Sense Tempo feature. To use Identify Beats, select some notes that you would like to use as indicators of where the beats are in the music, and then choose Identify Beats from the Region menu.

You can make riffs out of just about anything, such as a bass line or keyboard lick. The only restriction is that the riff can only use one sound. If you have music belonging to more than one player selected, it will be merged together into a single riff.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Create Play Loop</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">A play loop is a region of material that repeats itself within the section for as many times as you specify. The Create Play Loop command creates a play loop out of the currently selected material. If nothing is selected, then the measure containing the playback wiper becomes the source measure for the loop. For your convenience, FreeStyle automatically figures out how many repeats are necessary to make the loop play for the entire length of the section.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm48.jpg" title="bm48.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The benefit of creating a play loop instead of just copying and pasting by hand is that if you make a change to the original material, the change is automatically reflected in all iterations of the loop. You can even make modifications to iterations within a play loop (called overrides) so that the loop doesn't sound exactly the same each time it repeats. <br>

</font><font size="2">This command operates on the measure that currently holds the playback wiper. It allows you to modify notes in the measure that are part of a playback loop without affecting other repititions of the the loop. For example, you might want to create a drum fill in one measure of a drum loop without causing the fill to be in any other measures in the loop.<font size="3"><br>

You can choose whether or not to include durations when quantizing with the Affect Durations check box. The Time offset slider lets you shift all notes a little bit earlier or later than the grid locations themselves, which occur on exact beat divisions, creating either a pushed or laid back feel. The Swing slider lets you shift every other grid point to create jazz and hip-hop feels.<font size="3"><br>

Note that all of these commands can be mapped to a remote control key on your MIDI keyboard (or other controller), which frees you up completely from the computer while recording.

</font><font size="2">Makes any music you have just recorded permanent in the sense that it will no longer be susceptible to the Undo Record command. Use this command if you are happy with what you have recorded so far and you want to keep it. After using the Keep Recording command, you can record more overdubs into the same take and freely use Undo Record without losing the "kept" material.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">A take is a place to store a performance by a single player in a specific section of music. You can record as many takes as you want for each player. Takes are numbered consecutively, and they can be instantly accessed from the take pop-up menu next to each player in the Ensemble window as shown below. You can also type single-digit numbers to select one of the first ten takes for a player, or use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through all the takes. The New Take command creates a new, empty take for the currently record-enabled player. It does the same thing as choosing New from the take pop-up menu in the Ensemble window (as shown below). Once you've created a new take, you are ready to record into it.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Wait for Note</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When you start recording, Wait for Note causes FreeStyle to repeat measure zero indefinitely until you play the first note. After the first note is received, FreeStyle continues on into measure 1 the next time it reaches the end of measure 0. You can play notes anywhere in measure 0 as pickup notes to the section. FreeStyle is also intelligent about notes played a little past the downbeat of measure 1 and will adjust these notes to their correct position instead of putting them at the very beginning of the pickup measure. Wait for Note is a checkable menu item. Check it to turn it on; uncheck it to turn it off.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Auto Loop Record</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">During recording, Auto Loop Record causes FreeStyle to automatically loop back to the beginning of your performance two bars after you stop recording. Just lift your hands off your MIDI keyboard and wait a couple bars. FreeStyle automatically returns to where you began recording and starts playing from there. It also turns on the Record Loop (if it isn't already on) so that the section will continue looping until you stop playback with the main transports. FreeStyle also stays in record so that you can continue recording into the section if you'd like. Auto Loop Record is a checkable menu item. Check it to turn it on; uncheck it to turn it off.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Smooth Record Loop</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When Smooth Record Loop is turned on, notes that are recorded in the pickup bar are automatically played at the end of the record loop. Often when you record a loop, you play pickup notes into bar one, or you play notes on the down beat of bar one a little bit early. In either case, these notes are not actually in the loop because they occur before beat 1 of the first measure. As a result, they do not play when the section loops back to the first measure. Smooth Record Loop automatically places pickup bar notes at the end of the loop so that they seamlessly lead into the beginning of the loop when it repeats. If you hear a "gap" when the section repeats, try turning on Smooth Record Loop; most likely, the "gap" effect will go away. Smooth Record Loop is a checkable menu item. Check it to turn it on; uncheck it to turn it off.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Follow Song</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle lets you record into sections and also into songs. The Follow Song command affects the process of recording into a song.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Turning Off Follow Song</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When it is turned off (unchecked), FreeStyle only records into the currently record-enabled section in the Arrangement window (indicated by a red bar as shown below). To make a section record-enabled, just click it.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm66.jpg" title="bm66.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">As playback proceeds through the song, FreeStyle only drops into record when it reaches the record-enabled section. If the section appears in the song more than once, FreeStyle drops into record each time it reaches the record-enabled section. In the example above, recording would occur only when the verse plays at measures 8-17. (Note that this range includes the measure before and the measure after the section. That's because each section has a "pickup" and "overhang" measure.) FreeStyle drops out of recording during sections that are not record-enabled (no red bar).<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Turning On Follow Song</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When Follow Song is turned on (checked), FreeStyle records into each section in the top row of the Arrangement Window as it plays. The top row is called the primary song structure row. Notice that the Verse section is record-enabled because it is currently playing (the scrolling playback wiper is in it). When the wiper reaches the next section, Chorus, it will become record-enabled.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm67.jpg" title="bm67.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">As you can see, the Follow Song feature lets you set up sections in a song before recording and then record into them continuously from one to the next. FreeStyle automatically places what you play in each appropriate section. You can easily go back and forth between this style of "linear" recording within a song and loop-recording within a single section. The Follow Song feature gives you the best of both worlds.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Using Follow Song with Stationery</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The follow song command can be used any time you wish to record without being concerned about what section you are in. It is ideal when used with FreeStyle Stationery files, which are song templates with sections already set up in them, ready for you to record into when you start a new document.<br>

</font><font size="2">After choosing a section, you can use this command to make an exact copy of the section. The copy appears at the bottom of the section list with the word copy appended to the original name as shown below. The copy is completely separate; it is not "linked" or otherwise related to the original in any way, so you can freely modify it without affecting the original section. Duplicating is useful when you want to use an existing section as a basis for new material.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">It is not necessary to duplicate sections before adding multiple copies of a section to a song in the arrangement grid. Just drag in as many copies of a section as you want. Unlike the sections made from the Duplicate command, copies dragged into the arrangement grid are references to the original; this means that if you change the original, all instances of it in the song will change, too. If you want to make one instance of a section different from the others, make a copy of it using the Duplicate Section command.<br>

</font></span></b><u><img data="bm2.jpg" title="bm2.jpg"></u><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">In FreeStyle, you work with players in an ensemble; each player represents a different instrument, such as guitar, bass, drums, piano, and so on. Each player must be assigned to an instrument sound in your MIDI playback device before you can begin using FreeStyle. Otherwise, the player may not play the correct sound.<br>
</font>If the device you are using for playback is not a General MIDI device, you need to choose a sound for each FreeStyle player manually. Since you are just starting out with FreeStyle, the best way to do this is to edit the Player Templates in the Player Library so that FreeStyle will remember the sound you have chosen any time you create a new file.<br>
To choose sounds for the player templates in the Player Library:<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Close the currently open FreeStyle document by choosing Close from the File menu.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">If you have modified the file in any way, it will ask you if you would like to save changes. At this point, you probably haven't done anything that you want to keep yet, so click No.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Go to the Setup menu, and choose Edit Player Library under the Player Library entry.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Player library window appears.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Choose each player template one at a time from the drop-down list at the top of the window, and for each one choose an appropriate sound from the Sound drop-down list below the player name.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">At this point, what you see in the sound drop-down list depends on whether or not FreeStyle is familiar with your MIDI instrument. If it is, then the sound drop-down list displays the device's factory default sounds, and you can continue to assign sounds to your players. If not, see <u>What to do if you see a generic sound list</u></font> or <u>What to do if you see MIDI channels instead of a sound list</u>.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font size="1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</font><b><font color="#0000a0">What to do for MIDI devices that do not appear in FreeStyle's list</font></b><br>
<font size="2">First of all, don't despair. You can use FreeStyle with any MIDI-equipped multi-timbral sound module, keyboard synthesizer, or other MIDI sound source.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">If you have a MIDI device that doesn't appear in the Studio Setup drop-down list, this only means that FreeStyle isn't yet customized to support that specific instrument. This means a little bit of extra setup on your part. But Once the device is set up, you will be able to choose sounds from it in FreeStyle just as easily as devices that FreeStyle knows about.<br>
To set up a device that doesn't appear in the drop-down list:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Choose the Other category in the drop-down list.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The device name will change to "Device 1".<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click the expand icon (&nbsp;+&nbsp;) to the left of the device name, and then click the additional expand icon to open the Details section.<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the "Name" section, rename the device as desired.<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the "Transmit" and "Receive" sections, indicate the MIDI channels on which the device sends and receives MIDI data.<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Properties drop-down list, check the device properties that apply to your device.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">This step is important because it determines how FreeStyle will interact with the device.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the device is a General MIDI (GM) device, be sure to indicate this by checking the General MIDI device property.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">This lets you access all of the GM sounds by name from within FreeStyle.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Choose the "Does not accept program changes" property if any of the following are true:</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The device has no built-in sounds (such as a sampler).<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You prefer to access specific MIDI channels on the device, rather than choosing sounds by name and letting FreeStyle dynamically allocate MIDI channels.<br>
<img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You frequently change the bank(s) of internal sounds in the device and therefore need to be able to set up sounds on a per-channel basis.<font size="3"><br>
<p><hr><p>
</font></font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">What to do if you see a generic sound list<br>
<u><img data="bm2.jpg" title="bm2.jpg"></u></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">If you see a generic sound list with names like "Patch&nbsp;1" and "Patch&nbsp;2", you have several choices.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">One choice is to just use the generic sound names. The patch numbers refer to the MIDI program change number for each sound in the MIDI instrument. All you have to do is find out what the MIDI program change number is for the sound you want to choose. For some devices, this is easy because of the way they work or because the program change numbers are easy to find in the user's manual.<br>
In the meantime, contact Mark of the Unicorn regarding your instrument and we'll gladly add it to our list of devices to support in future updates of FreeStyle. For information on contacting Mark of the Unicorn by phone, fax, or e-mail, see <u>Technical support</u></font>.<br>
If you consider yourself to be somewhat of a "hacker", you can create your own custom sound list. Doing so involves editing text files in the freemidi directory that provide device information and sound names to FreeStyle.<br>
To create a custom sound list for your MIDI instrument, open and read the following text files (located in the freemidi directory located in your Windows directory), which contain instructions at the beginning that tell you how to create your own device definitions and sound name lists:<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2"><img data="bm33.jpg" title="bm33.jpg"><span style="font-size:6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</font></font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">What to do if you see MIDI channels instead of a sound list<br>
</font></span></b><u><img data="bm2.jpg" title="bm2.jpg"></u><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Earlier, in the Studio Setup window, you indicated that you have a sampler or other device with no built-in sounds, and you chose the Does not accept program changes device property for it as explained in <u>What to do for MIDI devices that do not appear in FreeStyle's list</u></font>. You also specified a range of MIDI channels that the device can receive MIDI data on. In this case, the sound pop-up menu displays the list of MIDI channels.<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When you use MIDI channel assignments like this instead of sound names, FreeStyle does not employ dynamic channel allocation during playback for the player. Instead, it always uses the channel you've chosen for the player. This is ideal for situations where sounds cannot be called up on an instrument using MIDI program change events. It is also the only way to override FreeStyle's dynamic channel allocation, which you may want to avoid for other reasons.<br>
</font>To assign a sound in the sampler to a player in the Ensemble palette, a player template in the Player Library, or a riff in the Metronome dialog box, set up the sampler so that it will play the sound on a specific MIDI channel, and then assign the player to that same channel.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Guidelines for Choosing a Playback Device <u><img data="bm2.jpg" title="bm2.jpg"></u></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">FreeStyle plays music best on a multi-timbral MIDI sound module or synthesizer that provides a good variety of instrument sounds. Multi-timbral means that the instrument can play more than one type of sound at a time (drums, bass, piano, etc.)<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Why having a multi-timbral sound module or synthesizer is important</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle depends on your MIDI hardware to produce sounds. For example, when you record a piano part in FreeStyle, your MIDI sound module produces the piano sound that you hear. FreeStyle itself produces no sound whatsoever. Instead, FreeStyle precisely records performance information: <i>when</i></font> notes were played, <i>what</i> notes were played, <i>how hard</i> they were struck, <i>how long</i> they were held down, and so on. During playback, FreeStyle sends this performance information to the MIDI sound module, triggering the music that you hear. This is one of the reasons why MIDI sequencing is so powerful. It gives you incredible flexibility in working with the performances you record and the instruments and sounds you choose to play them with.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">FreeStyle supports General MIDI devices</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle works great with any MIDI compatible synthesizer. But many people find General MIDI devices particularly easy to set up and use. General MIDI is a term that refers to an industry-accepted standard setup for a multi-timbral MIDI device. MIDI devices vary widely in their architecture, sounds, and capabilities. General MIDI devices adhere to a simple set of characteristics that make them similar to all other General MIDI devices. For example, every General MIDI device provides a standard set of musical instrument sounds, including piano, bass, guitar, strings, various drum kits, and others. If a MIDI device supports General MIDI, you can be sure that it has this standard set of GM sounds. Many GM devices provide additional sounds as well. General MIDI includes other standard musical characteristics such as reverb, chorusing, and so on.<font size="3"><br>

FreeStyle's metronome can play a speaker click on the computer's internal speaker or a click that consists of any sound (such as a side stick or rim shot) produced by a MIDI drum machine or other MIDI instrument. It can also play a custom riff. A riff is a musical phrase played by a single player, usually a drummer. FreeStyle provides a wide selection of stock riffs; most are in the form of two-bar drum loops. You can create your own riffs by using the Save As Metronome command in the Region menu or by placing a standard MIDI file (.MID) in the FreeStyle's metronom directory. (To delete a riff, just remove it from the directory.) Note that a riff doesn't have to be a drum loop; it can be any single instrument that you want, such as a bass loop or a keyboard riff.<font size="3"><br>

The Remote Controls are only active while the key clump is being held down. This makes it next to impossible to accidentally enable the Remotes. Best of all, you can choose any combination of keys you want. FreeStyle's factory default key clump is C1Db1D1. You can, however, choose any combination of keys you want--anything that you are sure you will never play--by dragging the trigger key onto the desired keyboard keys. If you don't want to use the key clump technique, you can use a MIDI controller instead.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Sync</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">What is synchronization?</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle's synchronization features allow it to play in time with other devices. For example, you can make a drum machine play along precisely with FreeStyle. Or you can do it the other way around and make FreeStyle follow the drum machine. In either case, the two will remain tightly in sync. They will start, stop, rewind, and locate together, and their playback won't drift over time.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">FreeStyle supports several industry standard synchronization formats to ensure synchronization compatibility in any situation.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">The Sync command</font></b><br>
<font size="2">To get sync going, choose Sync from the Setup menu. Use the FreeStyle Receives Sync option when you want FreeStyle to follow ('slave to') another device. Use the FreeStyle Sends Beat Clocks and FreeStyle Sends MTC options when you would like other devices to follow time code generated by FreeStyle. Use the Destination pop-up menu to tell FreeStyle where to send MIDI beat clocks or MIDI Time Code.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">MIDI Time Code</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Use this option when you would like FreeStyle to follow ('slave to') to MIDI Time Code sent by another device, such as a SMPTE-to-MIDI converter. Type in the start frame, which is the SMPTE frame time (in hours, minutes, seconds and frames) at which you want FreeStyle to begin playing your song. The frame time you type in here corresponds to the down beat of measure zero (the pickup bar) in your song. Make sure that the frame rate setting matches the SMPTE time code frame rate of the incoming time code.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">FreeStyle Sends MTC</font></b><br>
<font size="2">This option, when chosen, causes FreeStyle to generate MIDI Time Code during playback (and recording). Choose the desired destination for the MIDI Time Code from the pop-up menu provided.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Standard beat clocks</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle can either follow or generate standard MIDI beat clocks. Use the Standard Beat Clocks option when you want FreeStyle to slave to standard MIDI beat clocks generated by a drum machine or other MIDI device (or software). Use the FreeStyle Sends Beat Clocks option when you would like FreeStyle to send them to another device. The various related settings for beat clocks are discussed below.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Implementations of MIDI sync have evolved over the years. As a result, not all devices transmit and send MIDI clock signals in the same way. FreeStyle provides several options for maximum synchronization compatibility with your master device. The default settings reflect the most commonly used MIDI standards. It is best to leave them set this way unless you experience problems when synchronizing.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">24 clocks per metronome click / 24 clocks per quarter note</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Some manufacturers have begun to make devices which send 24 clock signals per beat (one click of the device's metronome) instead of the standard 24 clocks per quarter note. This new method is very useful when there are meters which do not use the quarter note as the beat unit: 3/8, 5/16, etc. In 6/8, for example, there might be a metronome click every three eighth notes; in 4/1, the metronome would click once every whole note. If you were using a less common meter such as 5/32 or 3/16 + 4/16, using the quarter note as the timing base would not be very useful. Instead, use the 24 clocks per metronome click option.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Start on any clock</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When this option is checked, FreeStyle will automatically start if it receives a time clock even if no start or continue command was received. This option is necessary when using some early MIDI devices which don't send start or continue commands, only timing clocks.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">First clock is time 1</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When this option is checked, FreeStyle interprets the first MIDI clock signal it receives as the second timing clock of the sequence, 1/24th of a beat after the beginning. Devices manufactured recently send the first clock signal (time 0) after the start command for the sequence. Some earlier devices assume the start command to be the first clock signal. The first clock signal they send would be 1/24th of a beat after the beginning. If you are using one of these devices, you should check this option.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Since manufacturers rarely explain this aspect in their documentation, you may not know if your device behaves this way. The best way to find out is to experiment: set the metronome to the slowest possible tempo, play both devices (with FreeStyle as slave) and listen for discrepancies in attacks and beat alignment. The difference of 1/24th of a beat is very audible at a slow tempo. If FreeStyle seems slightly behind the master device, try checking this option.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">About MIDI synchronization</font></b><br>
<font size="2">MIDI Beat Clocks: consist of a continuous stream of real-time messages. They are produced by most MIDI compatible drum machines and sequencers, and by some synthesizers (particularly those with built-in sequencers). MIDI beat clocks are transmitted 24 times per beat. If the master device changes tempo, the MIDI beat clocks slow down or speed up accordingly; any slave device will follow this tempo change.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Start, Stop, and Continue: Most devices that generate MIDI beat clocks also send Start, Stop, and Continue messages; slave devices will start playback, pause, rewind, or play from the current location according to the combination of these messages received.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Song Position Pointer: In addition, many devices send Song Position Pointer data. These messages set the current location for playback, much like setting the Counter in FreeStyle.<font size="3"><br>

</font><font size="2">The in-depth analysis that FreeStyle performs on your music to spell notes correctly takes time. If you have a slower computer, you can speed up the time it takes FreeStyle to draw notation by turning off (unchecking) Smart Note Spellings. If you would also like this option to be disabled in all newly created documents, uncheck the Smart Note Spellings option in the Notation Preferences dialog (which can be opened by choosing Preferences from the Edit menu). When the Smart Note Spellings option is turned off, FreeStyle still spells notes correctly according to the current key signature and mode (major or minor), but it does not analyze the musical context of the note. In most cases, FreeStyle's choices for note spelling are still quite acceptable, and you can always manually tweak individual note spellings by double-clicking the note and choosing the desired spelling in the Note Detail dialog.<font size="3"><br>

For example, the title might be given the First Pages setting, but a page number might be given the Body Pages setting. If an item is grayed out, it is because it does not apply to the situation; for example, if the notation window is currently displaying a left-hand page, the Right Pages command is grayed out. See the table below for a summary.<br>
</font>When choosing which pages to display text on, keep in mind that FreeStyle has two separate text layouts in the notation view: one for instrument parts (used when any player is displayed by itself) and another for scores (viewing multiple players together). When you display a single player by itself, FreeStyle displays the single-player text regardless of what player is being shown (except for the player's name, which changes to show the correct instrument name).<br>

Then create a new text box by clicking anywhere on the page, or edit an existing text box by clicking on it. Choose Insert Part Name from the Text menu. The part name appears at the location of the text cursor. The part name can be selected, cut, copied, pasted and formatted with any font and text setting (e.g. bold, italic, etc.) The only thing you can't do to a part name is edit the specific letters in the name. FreeStyle won't even let you position the text cursor in the middle of a part name. To change the part name itself, change the name of the player in the Ensemble window. To make the part name appear in all parts, give it the All Pages text setting. To make it appear on the first page of all parts, give it the First pages text setting.<br>

</font><font size="2">This preference determines what happens when you paste notes into a region of time where controller events currently exist, and the notes you are pasting have controller events along with them. The easiest way to understand this is through an example. Let's say that you have copied a section of notes into the clipboard. FreeStyle has automatically included some volume controllers because they affect the notes you just copied. Now you go to paste the notes somewhere else, but there happens to be volume controllers at the location where you are pasting. When Keep Destination Controllers is unchecked, the volume controllers in the clipboard are pasted with the notes, and they replace the controllers at the paste destination. When Keep Destination Controllers is checked, the volume controllers in the clipboard are not pasted with the notes, and the controllers at the paste destination remain unaffected.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Auto-Select Controllers</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The Auto-Select Controllers feature applies musical "intelligence" to MIDI data recorded into FreeStyle. When this option is checked, pitch bend, volume changes, and other aspects of the musical performance that consist of MIDI controller data in the controller pane are automatically "linked" to the notes that they affect. As a result, you can select move, cut, copy, paste and otherwise edit notes, and the controller data is automatically included with the notes. This means that you don't have to worry about pitch bend or similar data; FreeStyle takes care of it automatically for you when you edit the notes. The example below shows how the pitch bend in the controller pane is selected when the note is selected.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2"><img data="bm7.jpg" title="bm7.jpg"></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When the Auto Select Controllers option is turned off, notes and controller data must be selected and edited separately.<font size="3"><br>

Note that these special assignments for function keys will be in effect only when the event list is the frontmost window. At all other times, the function keys will act normally as menu accelerator keys. If you wish the function keys to always act as menu accelerator keys -- even when the event list is frontmost -- then do not check the &quot;Enable Function Keys&quot; checkbox in the Event List preferences window.

</font><font size="2">If you are having trouble getting FreeStyle to call up the right sounds on your MIDI instrument, there may be one or more settings that you need to make in the instrument so that it responds properly to FreeStyle. For detailed information about your MIDI instrument, see <u>How to set up your MIDI instrument for FreeStyle</u></font>.<font size="3"><br>

</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">Display seems to stall and skip</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">You may be running into the limits of your computer's processing power. FreeStyle gives priority to sending and receiving MIDI data over most screen redisplays. However, with enough of an overload you may hear delays or erratic timing in your music. <br>
</font>Usually the overload is caused by vast reams of aftertouch (mono or poly key pressure), controller, or pitch bend events in one or more synthesizer tracks.<br>
To solve the problem, you must reduce the amount of MIDI information being sent by FreeStyle in one of the following ways:<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Slow down the tempo of the sequence during the problem passages. <br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Delete unneeded aftertouch or other controller data in the controller view. (See <u>Controllers</u></font> for more information.)<br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Delete a track or tracks from the sequence.<br>

<b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Setting Up Your Instrument <u><img data="bm2.jpg" title="bm2.jpg"></u></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><span style="font-size:16pt"><font color="#800040">General advice about setting up your MIDI device</font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2"> When you are setting up a MIDI synthesizer or sound module to use it with FreeStyle, the goal is to be able to access as many sounds as possible in the device by name from within FreeStyle, and to get it to play as many different sounds as possible at the same time.<br>
</font>FreeStyle supports the devices listed in this section as best as it can. In order to do so, it assumes that the instrument is pretty much like it was when you first pulled it out of the box. This is especially true with regard to the automatic sound lists that appear for the device within FreeStyle. Most General MIDI devices work great with FreeStyle--even without any changes to the module itself by you. If you've made only a few changes to the instrument's settings, it should work fine, as long as you follow the recommendations mentioned in this on-line help for the device. If you've made substantial changes to the instrument (such as changing the internal banks of sounds), the sound lists probably won't work.<br>
Here is a checklist of things you want to look into for a device if things don't seem to be working quite right:<font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make sure the device you are using is set up for multi-timbral operation with a sequencer. There is a wide variety of ways that devices handle this, so there is no set rule we can recommend here. Check the device's manual. (Many Korg and Yamaha devices call it &quot;Multi&quot; mode. Many Roland devices call it &quot;Performance&quot; mode.)<br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FreeStyle attempts to use all channels that it thinks are available in the device. Some MIDI devices always receive on all 16 channels. Others can only receive on 8 channels at a time, and you can often choose which channels you want to use. In addition, many instruments let you turn channels off if you want. In general, make sure FreeStyle knows which channels are available and which ones aren't. You do this in the Studio Setup command in the Setup menu. (If you get the Easy Setup window, you may need to click the &quot;Launch Config program&quot; button and then double-click on the icon of the device that appears.) Double-check the device to make sure its settings match what you tell FreeStyle.<br>
</font>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If your device is a controller, and you are also using it as a sound source for FreeStyle, make sure that its &quot;Local Control&quot; feature is turned off. Local control makes the keys on the keyboard trigger sounds in the on-board synthesizer. Since you will be doing this via FreeStyle, you want to turn it off in the synth itself. Otherwise, you'll trigger it from both the keyboard and FreeStyle and you'll get doubled notes.<br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
FreeStyle uses MIDI system exclusive, bank select, and program change events to call up sounds on MIDI devices. Be sure your device is set up so that it will respond to these types of messages. If it isn't, FreeStyle won't play the correct sounds.<br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some devices can handle drum kits on any receive channel. Others force you to use drums on only a particular channel (usually channel 10). If so, FreeStyle needs to know which channel is reserved for drums. For the devices listed in this section, this has already been set up for you.<br>
&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Finally, check our web site (www.motu.com) for information about which new devices we are supporting. FreeMIDI has a feature called &quot;default names files,&quot; which are text files that describe the stock patch lists for a musical device. If you cannot choose your device name in FreeStyle's Easy Setup Window, that means that a &quot;default names file&quot; does not exist for your device in the FreeMIDI folder within your System folder. However, you might be able to download a new default names file and an updated Devices.ini file from our web site that will add support for your device. The web site also contains updated information about how best to set up all supported devices for use with FreeStyle. See especially www.motu.com/freestyle.<font size="3"><br>

</font></font><b><span style="font-size:20pt"><font color="#408080">Alesis <u><img data="bm2.jpg" title="bm2.jpg"></u></font></span></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">Important Note</font></b><br>

</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Alesis Serial MIDI Driver Tips</font></b><br>
<font size="2">If you intend to connect your Alesis keyboard directly to your computer using the Alesis Serial MIDI Driver and the special cable, the following steps may help you get set up more quickly.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">1. On your keyboard, find the &quot;global&quot; settings (for example, on a QS-6, press &quot;Edit Select&quot; and then &quot;Global&quot;).<br>
2. Locate the serial connection speed setting (on a QS-6, press either one of the &quot;Page&quot; buttons until you reach the &quot;I/O&quot; setting).<br>
3. Make sure the speed is set to the &quot;38.4&quot; selection (on a QS-6, the I/O settings should read &quot;PC 3.84Kbaud&quot;). If this speed setting is incorrect, the Alesis Serial MIDI driver will not be able to locate your Alesis device.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">For more information on the Alesis Serial MIDI driver, please contact Alesis or your Alesis dealer.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">Quadrasynth and S4</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle puts the QuadraSynth/S4 into Mix mode automatically. For best results, you should refrain from taking the QuadraSynth/S4 out of this mode while using FreeStyle. There is no way to choose from which bank, user or preset, a program is recalled when FreeStyle sends a program change message. Therefore, you will need to manually switch the QuadraSynth/S4 to the desired bank, user or preset, before selecting a program name from the popup patch list. There are multiple possible default patch lists for the QuadraSynth/S4. This is because different version of the QuadraSynth/S4 ROM contained different factory-installed programs. The current list installed is for ROM v 1.07. Contact Mark of the Unicorn technical support if you have an older ROM version and want the matching default patch lists.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">QS-series (QS-6,QS-7,QS-8)</font></b><br>
<font size="2">First, in order to prepare your QS keyboard for use with an external sequencer like FreeStyle, do the following:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">1. On the QS keyboard press the &quot;Edit Select&quot; button<br>
2. Press the &quot;Bank -&gt;&quot; (global) button<br>
3. Press the &quot;Page -&gt;&quot; button and scroll to window &quot;P6&quot;<br>
4. Press the &quot;Value Up&quot; button until it says &quot;KBD MODE: Out 01&quot; (Actually, any of Out 01 through Out 16 will work. The &quot;NORMAL&quot; setting and the &quot;CH SOLO&quot; settings will not work.)</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When you launch FreeStyle, it will automatically put the QS keyboard into &quot;General MIDI Mode&quot;. In this mode, GM drum kits can be accessed via the Metronome and/or by a Player. Regretfully, when in GM Mode, the QS ignores any bank select messages that are sent to it, only accessing patches in the &quot;Preset Programs 4&quot; bank. You therefore should use menu item &quot;Setup \ Player Library \ Edit Player Library&quot; in order to edit FreeStyle's Player Library so that every player uses a sound in the &quot;Preset Programs 4&quot; bank. Once you have done that, all of FreeStyle's metronomes and predefined ensembles will work properly.<br>
</font>Alternatively, you can take the QS keyboard out of GM mode. In this mode you will be able to use sounds from all banks except for the drum kits bank, and the QS keyboard will accept bank select messages from FreeStyle. The only downside of this mode is that you'll have to hunt around in the other banks for drum kits, and some of FreeStyle's Riff Metronomes may not work. To get out of General MIDI mode, follow these steps after launching FreeStyle: <font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font size="1">1. On the QS keyboard press the &quot;Edit Select&quot; button.<br>
2. Press the &quot;Bank -&gt;&quot; (global) button. <br>
3. Press the &quot;Page -&gt;&quot; button and scroll to window &quot;P7&quot;. <br>
4. Press the &quot;Value Down&quot; button to select, &quot;General MIDI:OFF&quot;.</font></b><font size="3"><br>

</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">ESQ-1</font></b><br>
<font size="2">For best results with FreeStyle, set up the ESQ-1 by setting the MIDI Basechannel to 1 and assigning each of Tracks 1-8 to MIDI channels 1-8. Also, set the MIDI Mode to be MULTI and Local Control OFF.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">ESQ-M</font></b><br>
<font size="2">For best results with FreeStyle, set up the ESQ-M by setting the MIDI Base channel to 1 and assigning each of Tracks 1-8 to MIDI channels 1-8. Also, set the MIDI Mode to be MULTI.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">VFX SD</font></b><br>
<font size="2">For best results with FreeStyle, set up the VFX by setting the MIDI Mode to be MULTI and Local Control OFF.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">TS-10</font></b><br>
<font size="2">For best results with FreeStyle, FreeMIDI automatically puts the TS-10 into Multi-Mode. If SYS-EX is set to OFF, you should set it to ON before using it with FreeStyle. To do so press the MIDI Control button until you see the page that displays 'SYS-EX = '. You should leave the TS-10 in Multi-Mode. Once in this mode, you should make sure that each track is assigned a unique MIDI channel from 1-12. Note however that in Multi-Mode only the 'Sound Banks' are available. YOU WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE 'PRESET BANKS'.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Also, you should disable local control manually on the TS-10. To do so: Press the 'TRACK MIDI' button until you come to 'SEND/RECV'. Use the DATA ENTRY Slider to set the parameter to 'LOCAL-OFF'. You will need to do this individually to each of the 12 Tracks.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">KS-32</font></b><br>
<font size="2">You must perform a one-time setup for the KS-32 so it can be used with FreeStyle. Once you have done the following, you will save your setup as a preset which can be recalled at any time by pressing three buttons on the KS-32:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Enable Bank Select and Program changes:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1"><font color="#400040">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</font><font size="2">Enable MIDI Controllers:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">(Do this if you want to record and play back things like sustain pedal, pitch bend, mod wheel, pressure, volume, etc. If you donŐt make this setting, the volume slider in FreeStyleŐs ensemble window will not work.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press the System*MIDI button</font></b><font size="3"><br>

<b><font size="1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use left or right arrow keys to select 'MIDI Mode =' value</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use up/down arrow to set MIDI Mode = MULTI</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Allow System Exclusive Messages:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press the System*MIDI button</font></b><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press the Screen 9 button</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use left or right arrow keys to select 'System Excl =' value</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use up/down arrow to set System Excl = ON</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Create a Preset for the KS-32 that will allow FreeStyle to play multiple sounds:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press the 'Select Seq/Preset' button</font></b><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Use the row of buttons labelled 'bank' and 'screen' to find an unused preset number between 00 and 99. Try number 30 by pressing bank 3, screen 0. If you have found an unused preset number, the display will say 'EMPTY SEQ/PSET'</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press the 'Edit Track' button</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press the Tracks 1 button -- a red light will glow next to it.</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now use the left and right arrows to step through each of the following settings, and the up and down arrows to change settings until they appear as follows:</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Vol = 99 Pan = SOUND &lt;-- Set vol settings identically for each track<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Output = CONTROL<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Key Range = A0 - C8 &lt;-- This makes all notes available on each track<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Transpose = +0 +00<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Chan = 01 Prog = 01 &lt;-- Set Chan = track #. Prog can be anything.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Status = MIDI &lt;-- This is what other synths call 'local off'<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Pressure = CHANNEL<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">SustainPedal = ON<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Timbre = 00<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Release = +00<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Repeat this process for Track buttons 2 through 8. The settings should be identical for each track, except that on each track you must set 'Chan =' the track number. This will allow FreeStyle to play back up to 8 players simultaneously and independently on the KS-32.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
<b><font size="1">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Press the 'Enter*Save' button and use the left and right arrows and the Data Entry slider to select a name for your preset. You can also use the up and down arrows for stepping through letters slowly. Perhaps you should name it 'FreeStyle'. When you are done naming the preset, press the 'Enter*Save' button again and the KS-32 will save your preset.</font></b></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Now whenever you want to use FreeStyle with your KS-32, simply press the 'Select Seq/Preset' button and choose your FreeStyle preset by pressing the bank and screen buttons that correspond to the preset number you used. Do this before running FreeStyle so the keyboard will be in the proper mode.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Note that the settings you made for enabling bank select and program changes, for enabling MIDI controllers, and for putting the KS-32 into MULTI mode are not part of the preset, and therefore may have to be reset if you ever change them. However, the KS-32 will remember these settings even if you turn it off and back on again -- and there is rarely a reason to change them.<font size="3"><br>

</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">01/W-series</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle automatically puts the 01/W into Sequencer Mode. In order for FreeStyle to do this, system exclusive data reception must be enabled. To do so, press the Global button and use the cursor and H buttons to scroll to the EXCL: field and then press the UP button until EXCL:ENA is displayed. For best results, leave the 01/W in Sequencer mode while working with FreeStyle.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">i-series</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle automatically puts the i-series into Song Mode. In order for FreeStyle to do this, system exclusive data reception must be enabled. To do so, press the Global button and use the cursor and H buttons to scroll to the EXCL: field and then press the UP or DOWN button until EXCL:ENA is displayed. For best results, leave the i-series in Song mode while working with FreeStyle. After FreeStyle puts the i-series into Song mode or after you do so manually, you need to disable the sending of data from tracks in the song. To do so, use the Page buttons to find the Track Status page and set every track to EXT. The default is BOTH.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">N1 and N5</font></b><br>
<font size="2">First, make sure your keyboard is set to receive program changes, control changes, and system exclusive messages:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font face="New York"><font size="2">1) Press the &quot;Global&quot; button.<br>
2) Press the Page/Part &quot;Upper&quot; right arrow button three times so &quot;MIDI FILTER&quot; appears.<br>
3) If there is an &quot;X&quot; below &quot;PRG&quot;, &quot;CTRL&quot; or &quot;EXCL&quot; in the MIDI FILTER section, use the Cursor arrow buttons and the value slider to change those settings to &quot;O&quot; instead.</font></font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Secondly, make sure your keyboard's &quot;Local Control&quot; setting is OFF. This prevents duplicate notes from sounding while recording in FreeStyle. You will want to turn Local Control back ON after you are done using FreeStyle, so the keyboard will work normally when played by itself.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">1) Press the &quot;Global&quot; button.<br>
2) Press the Page/Part &quot;Upper&quot; right arrow button two times so &quot;KBD. CONTROL&quot; appears.<br>
3) Move the value slider until it says &quot;OFF&quot; below the heading &quot;LOCAL CTRL&quot;.</font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Thirdly, make sure that you have correctly set up your MIDI interface. If you are using a MIDI interface outside of the Korg keyboard, follow the directions given by the MIDI interface's maufacturer. If you are connecting your keyboard directly to your computer via the &quot;PC TO HOST&quot; port on the back of the keyboard (using the keyboard's internal MIDI interface), then you must to the following:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">1) Press the &quot;Global&quot; button.<br>
2) Press the Page/Part &quot;Upper&quot; right arrow button once so &quot;HARDWARE&quot; appears.<br>
3) Click the right cursor arrow once to highlight &quot;BPS&quot;.<br>
4) Move the value slider until the BPS setting is 38.4 (this is the correct setting for IBM PC compatible computers).</font><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">When connecting your keyboard directly to the computer, you must also install the KORG MIDI Driver before running FreeStyle (see N1/N5 manual chapter 4, section 2).<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">N1/N5 Sound Usage Restrictions</font></b><br>
<font size="2">When using an N1 or N5 keyboard with FreeStyle, you must use either all XG sounds, or no XG sounds at all. XG sounds are contained in the banks that begin with &quot;y:&quot;, plus the bank &quot;XG Drums.&quot; The reason for this is as follows:<br>
</font>Korg has implemented at least three different types of sound banks into these synths. There are Combination patches, Program patches, and General MIDI patches. In addition to General MIDI, Korg has implemented Roland's extended GM format (known as GS), and Yamaha's extended format (known as XG). Korg has done this so that a MIDI file prepared for any of these formats will get the correct patches on the synth (i.e., a Standard MIDI File mapped for XG synths will get the right sounds, and a file mapped for GS will also get the right sounds). Yamaha XG is a specific mode within the synth. In order to access XG sounds, FreeStyle has to send a system exclusive message to the synth that resets the synth to XG mode. This will happen whenever you choose an XG sound for a player in FreeStyle. In XG mode, you do not have access to the non-XG sounds in the keyboard. Therefore, as soon as you choose an XG sound for a player, any other player using a non-XG sound will suddenly start playing with an incorrect sound.<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font color="#0000a0">X-Series</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle automatically puts the X-Series into Sequencer Mode. In order for FreeStyle to do this, system exclusive data reception must be enabled. To do so, press the Global button and use the cursor buttons to scroll to page 3D FILTER2 and the EX: field. Press the YES button so that EX:ENA is displayed. For best results, leave the X-Series in Sequencer mode while working with FreeStyle. You must also assign each track, in whatever Song is current when you switch to Sequencer mode, to a unique MIDI channel from 1-16. To do so after switching to Sequencer mode, press the Channel button and use the left cursor button to select the Track field. Go through each track from 1-16 and assign each a track a unique MIDI channel from 1-16. The simplest setup would be to have Track 1=channel 1, Track 2= channel 2, Track 3= channel 3, etc.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IMPORTANT NOTE: if you are using the built-in MIDI interface on your KORG X5 (or other X-series synth) to connect it directly to the computer, see the important setup information at the end of this topic.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">03R/W</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Use 03R/W's front panel to manually enable system exclusive in the Global MIDI filter menu. After that, FreeStyle can automatically put the 03R/W into Multi mode. For best results with FreeStyle, you should leave the 03R/W in this mode.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">05R/W</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Use 05R/W's front panel to manually enable system exclusive in the Global MIDI filter menu (it should read &quot;EX:ENA&quot; on page 02C if you set it correctly). You only have to set this once because the 05R/W remembers the settings unless you change the battery or perform a Preset Data Load from page 05C. After that, FreeStyle can automatically put the 05R/W into Multi mode. For best results with FreeStyle, you should leave the 05R/W in this mode.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IMPORTANT NOTE: if you are using the built-in MIDI interface to connect your 05R/W directly to the computer, see the important setup information at the end of this topic.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">M1-series</font></b><br>
<font size="2">For best results in FreeStyle, put the M1 into Sequencer mode with a Song selected in which each track is set to one each of MIDI channels 1-8. Also, you should set the M1's global channel to be 16 or some other MIDI channel than 1-8.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">C-15/C-25</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Put the C-15/C-25 into MIDI Multi mode and set the MIDI receive channel to 1. Turn Local Control OFF. Set Program Change ON. Only change sounds from FreeStyle, do not use the voice selector buttons on the front panel.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">C-303/C-505</font></b><br>

</font>FreeStyle Setup:<br>
It is important to install and configure the KORG driver prior to launching FreeStyle for the first time. Not doing so may result in failed MIDI communication between the X5 and the computer. If this has happened, delete the file called 'fmsprefs' from the FreeMIDI directory, (which is located in the Windows directory) and proceed with the driver installation/configuration below.<br>
To install the KORG driver:<font size="3"><br>
</font><b><font size="1">1. Open the Drivers control panel and click the Add button/Select Unlisted or Updated driver in the Installed Drivers window and click OK.<br>
2. At the prompt, insert the FreeStyle disk 1 into drive A and click OK.<br>
3. Select the KORG PC/IF (for X5 series, 05R/W, AG-10) driver and click OK.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOTE: If an message appears indicating that the required driver is already installed on the system, select NEWER.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font size="1">4. When the driver has installed, a setup window will appear. Select the proper COM Port (usually COM Port 1) and click OK.</font></b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">The MIDI Out Messages should all be checked by default. The Independent Synth/MIDI Out check box is for enabling MIDI input to the KORG instrument from an external MIDI device.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">If the KORG instrument has been configured properly, you will be prompted to restart Windows. If the instrument has not been properly configured you will get the following error message:<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No KORG instruments are found on the COM Port. Check your hardware configuration and select proper port.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Be sure that all GLOBAL settings and cable connections are correct, and repeat the steps above. Once the driver is properly configured, continue to the next section.<br>
</font>Launching FreeStyle for the first time:<br>
After restarting Windows you are ready to launch FreeStyle. When you launch FreeStyle for the first time, you will be greeted by the following dialog box:<br>
Welcome to FreeStyle! FreeStyle has detected a KORG instrument directly connected to this computer...<br>
Click CONTINUE, and you will be prompted with the Studio Setup dialog screen. You should see a box-like icon, named X5, appear in this window. For further details on configuring your studio, please refer to the installation chapter in the FreeStyle User's Manual.<br>

<font size="2">There are two ways to connect the XP-10 to your computer: either using MIDI cables with a MIDI interface (such as the PC-MIDI Flyer, etc.) or directly connecting to the PC serial (COM) ports, using a special cable (purchased separately from Roland). It is important to install and configure the appropriate MIDI driver prior to launching FreeStyle for the first time. If you are using an interface, install the driver according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then read the section below, labeled &quot;If You Use a MIDI Interface&quot;. If you are using the ROLAND serial driver, simply follow the steps outlined in the section labeled &quot;If You Use a Serial Cable&quot;.<br>
</font>If you have attempted to run FreeStyle before installing the appropriate driver, FreeStyle may cause an erroneous studio setup document to be created, which will result in no MIDI communication between the XP-10 and the computer. If this has happened, delete the file called 'fmsprefs' from the FreeMIDI directory, (which is located in the Windows directory) and continue with the driver installation/configuration.<br>
<b>If You Use a MIDI Interface</b>:<br>
If you use MIDI cables, you will need two MIDI cables and a MIDI interface . (Please refer to the section labeled &quot;Connections Using MIDI Cables&quot; in Chapter 8 of the XP-10 manual for details on how to make the proper connections.) Set the computer switch on the rear panel of the XP-10 to &quot;MIDI&quot;. Turn &quot;Local Control&quot; Off on the XP-10. (Please refer to the section labelled &quot;Turn off the XP-10's Local Control&quot; in chapter 7 of the XP-10 manual for details.) After the initial WELCOME! message the program will present you with the Studio Setup window, where you tell FreeStyle what MIDI gear you have. Click on the drop-down list of devices and select XP-10 from the list of supported devices. NOTE: The default device is set to &quot;Generic GM&quot;. Click the Expand button to tell FreeStyle about the device's MIDI connections. If you have no other MIDI gear, click DONE. Otherwise, click the ADD button to add another device, and configure it appropriately. That's all there is to it!<br>
<b>If You Use a Serial Cable:</b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">If you use a serial cable, connections can be made directly to the COM port on the back of the PC. (Please refer to the section labeled &quot;Connections Using a Computer Cable&quot; in Chapter 8 of the XP-10 manual for details on how to make the proper connections.) Install the driver by referring to the section below that applies to you.<br>
</font><b>Windows 3.1 Installation of the ROLAND Serial MIDI Driver:</b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Set the computer switch on the rear panel of the XP-10 to &quot;PC-2&quot; prior to powering on the unit. Turn &quot;Local Control&quot; Off on the XP-10. (Please refer to the section labelled &quot;Turn off the XP-10's Local Control&quot; in chapter 7 of the XP-10 manual for details.) Open the Drivers control panel and click the Add button. Select Unlisted or Updated driver in the Installed Drivers window and click OK. Insert the FreeStyle disk 1 into your computer, select the appropriate drive to scan, and click OK. Select the Roland Serial MIDI (for XP-10, SC series, etc.) driver and click OK. Check that you have the correct COM port setting and RESTART WINDOWS.<br>
</font><b>Windows 95 Installation of the ROLAND Serial MIDI Driver:</b><font size="3"><br>
</font><font size="2">Set the computer switch on the rear panel of the XP-10 to &quot;PC-2&quot; prior to powering on the unit. Open Control Panel, double-click the Add New Hardware icon and click Next. When the Add New Hardware Wizard asks if you want it to scan for new hardware, click No. Clicking Yes won't work -- the Wizard does not know how to automatically recognize the ROLAND Serial MIDI driver. Select Sound, video and game controllers and click Next.When the Wizard asks for the manufacturer and model of your new hardware, click the special Have Disk... button. Insert the FreeStyle disk 1 into your computer, select the appropriate drive to scan, and click OK. After the Wizard scans the disk, it should present youwith a single choice for Roland Serial MIDI hardware. Click OK and then click Finish to have the Wizard install the driver software onto your computer. Finally, the Wizard should inform you that Windows must be restarted. When you launch FreeStyle for the first time, it should automatically detect a ROLAND device connected to the COM port, and assign the correct properties. If the PatchList for your device is not correct, simply select the correct patch list for your device from the drop-down menu.<font size="3"><br>

</font></font><font size="2">1) Press the &quot;Utility&quot; button.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">2) Turn the Page knob until the &quot;MIDI Ch)&quot; page appears<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">3) Set &quot;Local&quot; to &quot;off&quot; using knob 1.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">Thirdly, press the &quot;Perform&quot; button on your keyboard to put the synth into Performance mode. This is the proper mode to use when using your keyboard with a computer sequencer. Twirl the data knob until the Performance &quot;INT:128, Master KB,&quot; is selected. This stock Performance setting works pretty well with FreeStyle. For a complete description of how to tweak a Performance setting for use with a computer sequencer like FreeStyle, see the section in your keyboard manual entitled &quot;Using as a Multitimbral Tone Generator (Performance Mode)&quot; (S80 manual page 62).<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">If you are using an external MIDI interface, make sure that the &quot;HOST SELECT&quot; switch on the back of your keyboard is set to &quot;MIDI.&quot; You do not need to install the Yamaha CBX driver.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><font size="2">If you are connecting your keyboard directly to your computer via the &quot;TO HOST&quot; port on the back of the keyboard (using the keyboard's internal MIDI interface), then make sure that the &quot;HOST SELECT&quot; switch on the back of your keyboard is set to &quot;PC-2.&quot; In this case, you must also install the Yamaha CBX driver. See your &quot;Tools for S30/S80 &amp; CS6x/CS6R&quot; manual for directions on how to install the driver from the Tools CD-ROM that came with your keyboard. When installing the driver, do not choose the multiport option. Once the CBX driver is installed correctly and you have restarted Windows, choose &quot;Studio Setup&quot; from the Setup menu in FreeStyle and click on the Device Usage button. Make sure that the Yamaha CBX Driver item is checked and then click on OK. Click on the &quot;Add&quot; button and then use your mouse to change the new &quot;Device 1&quot; to be a Yamaha S30 or S80. Click on the plus sign to the left of the device to reveal the connection drop-down lists. Use the mouse to set the MIDI In and Out connections to use the CBX driver MIDI Out and MIDI In.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">CS1X</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle will automatically place the CS1X into Performance mode, allowing you to select Performances on MIDI channel 1, and XG patches on MIDI channels 5-16. If you would like to modify the patch list to enable XG sounds on all 16 MIDI channels, open the CS1X default names file (in the Yamaha folder in the Default Names folder in the FreeMIDI folder in your System Folder) and replace the sysex string for all of the XG banks with {f0 43 10 4c 00 00 7e 00 f7}:2 . However, this will cause any Performances previously selected to be switched to an XG patch. The Performance drum kits are only available on MIDI channel 5-16. If you have any difficulty selecting patches, make sure the CS1X is in Performance mode.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">MU50, MU80, MU100R</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle will automatically place the MU device into XG mode. Yamaha documentation says that channel 10 can only receive program changes for drum kits and ignores bank selects, but during testing our MU80 unit accepted bank select messages on all channels.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">PSR-530/630/730</font></b><br>
<font size="2">No specific preparations are necessary to use these devices with FreeStyle.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">QY70</font></b><br>
<font size="2">No specific preparations are necessary to use these devices with FreeStyle.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">RM50</font></b><br>
<font size="2">Setup the RM50 for FreeStyle by enabling a Device ID number. To do so, press the Utility button and then the Page buttons until you see the MIDI page. Press +1/Yes. Press the Page buttons until you see the Device number page. Enter a number. A value of 1 (one) will work fine unless you have more than one RM50 on the serial port, in which case you should give them each unique numbers. Do not use the ALL setting.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">SY77</font></b><br>
<font size="2">The SY77 must be in 'Multi-Mode', and be in 'Program Change DIRECT mode'. To set into 'Multi- Mode' press the button labeled 'Multi', to set to 'Program Change DIRECT', press 'Utility', choose 'Program Change', Press 'Enter', and using either the data entry slider or the '-1/NO', '+1/YES', select 'DIRECT'.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">SY99</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle automatically selects INT MULTI VOICE 1 and turns local control off. The default patch list will only work while the SY99 is in MULTI mode. If you need these to work in Voice Mode consult your SY99 user manual for the correct bank select messages, and modify the SY99 default names file (in the Yamaha folder in the Default Names folder in the FreeMIDI folder in your System Folder).<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">TG100</font></b><br>
<font size="2">No specific preparations are necessary to use this device with FreeStyle.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">TG500</font></b><br>
<font size="2">FreeStyle puts the TG500 into Multi mode automatically. For best results, do not change modes on the TG500 manually.<font size="3"><br>
</font></font><b><font color="#0000a0">TX81Z</font></b><br>
